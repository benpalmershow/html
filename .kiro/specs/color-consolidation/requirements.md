# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will systematically identify and consolidate similar colors across the project's CSS files to create a cleaner, more maintainable color system. The project currently has multiple CSS files with various color definitions that could be streamlined into a unified color palette using CSS custom properties.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate duplicate and similar color values across all CSS files, so that I can maintain a consistent color palette and reduce code redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing CSS files THEN the system SHALL identify all color values (hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, named colors)
2. WHEN comparing colors THEN the system SHALL group similar colors within a defined threshold (e.g., colors that are visually nearly identical)
3. WHEN consolidating colors THEN the system SHALL replace similar colors with a single representative color value
4. WHEN updating CSS THEN the system SHALL preserve existing CSS custom properties in :root and extend them as needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing design integrity while consolidating colors, so that the visual appearance remains consistent after optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating colors THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing dark mode color scheme functionality
2. WHEN updating colors THEN the system SHALL maintain the distinction between primary, secondary, accent, and utility colors
3. WHEN replacing colors THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast ratios are maintained for accessibility
4. WHEN consolidating THEN the system SHALL preserve platform-specific color branding (YouTube red, Spotify green, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize the consolidated colors into a logical CSS custom property system, so that future color management is simplified and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing colors THEN the system SHALL create or extend CSS custom properties in the :root selector
2. WHEN naming properties THEN the system SHALL use semantic naming conventions (--color-primary, --color-accent, etc.)
3. WHEN structuring THEN the system SHALL group related colors together (backgrounds, text, borders, etc.)
4. WHEN implementing THEN the system SHALL replace hardcoded color values with the new custom property references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused or redundant color definitions, so that the CSS codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing THEN the system SHALL identify color values that are no longer referenced
2. WHEN cleaning THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate color definitions
3. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL consolidate colors that serve the same semantic purpose
4. WHEN finalizing THEN the system SHALL ensure all color references point to valid custom properties or standard values
