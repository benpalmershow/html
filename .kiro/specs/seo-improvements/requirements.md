# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive SEO improvements for the Howdy, Stranger website to enhance search engine visibility, improve organic traffic, and provide better user experience. The website currently has basic SEO elements but lacks structured data, comprehensive meta tags, optimized content structure, and advanced SEO features that could significantly improve its search rankings and discoverability.

**Important Content Policy**: All SEO improvements must preserve existing content and functionality. No content should be modified, added, or removed from webpages without explicit user approval. SEO enhancements should focus on technical implementation (meta tags, structured data, performance optimizations) while maintaining the current content structure and user experience.
