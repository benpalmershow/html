# Federal Court Rules on Non-Citizens' First Amendment Rights

**Case:** AAUP v. Rubio, No. 25-10685-WGY (D. Mass. Sept. 30, 2025)  
**Judge:** William G. Young  
**Ruling:** Trump administration officials violated First Amendment rights of non-citizens through coordinated campaign to chill pro-Palestinian speech on college campuses.

## Core Constitutional Holding

### Why Non-Citizens Have First Amendment Rights

**Plain Text:** First Amendment states "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech" - draws no distinction between citizens and non-citizens

**Supreme Court Precedent:** *Bridges v. Wixon* (1945) held "freedom of speech...is accorded aliens residing in this country"

**Equal Protection:** Speech limits are "the same for both citizens and non-citizens alike"

**Modern Standard:** Non-citizens entitled to Brandenburg's "incitement test" requiring likelihood of imminent harm

> "No law means no law. The First Amendment does not draw President Trump's invidious distinction and it is not to be found in our history or jurisprudence."
>
> **- Judge Young**

## Key Findings

**Intentional Viewpoint Discrimination:** Officials systematically targeted pro-Palestine/anti-Israel speech to chill protected expression

**Unprecedented Use of Immigration Law:** Statutes INA 237(a)(4)(C) and INA 221(i) never before used for domestic political speech

**"Tiger Team" Investigation:** Used anonymous website lists (Canary Mission) to investigate 5,000+ campus protesters

**Masked Arrests:** Plain-clothed, often-masked federal agents conducted arrests designed to maximize fear

**Elastic "Antisemitism" Definition:** Officials conflated protected political speech with terrorism support

---

## Documented Cases

| Individual | Status | Alleged "Violation" |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Mahmoud Khalil** | Legal Permanent Resident | Negotiated between protesters and Columbia University |
| **Rümeysa Öztürk** | Student Visa | Co-authored op-ed critical of Israel's Gaza policies |
| **Mohsen Mahdawi** | Legal Permanent Resident | Arrested at citizenship interview after passing test |

## Chilling Effects on Academic Freedom

The court documented widespread self-censorship by plaintiff members:

- Professors cancelled international travel, including visits to dying relatives
- Scholars abandoned research projects on Palestine/Israel topics
- Faculty stopped signing open letters and attending protests
- Organizations diverted resources from core mission to immigration counseling

---

## Legal Violations Found

**Count I - First Amendment Viewpoint Discrimination:** GRANTED  
*Officials intentionally targeted specific viewpoints to chill speech*

**Count II - Campaign of Coercive Threats:** MIXED  
*Threats proved intentional chill but lacked specific targeting of plaintiffs*

**Count IV - Administrative Procedure Act:** GRANTED  
*Policy was contrary to constitutional right, arbitrary/capricious, and based on unprecedented statutory interpretation*

---

## Judge Young's Warning

> "If 'terrorist' is interpreted to mean 'pro-Palestine' or 'anti-Israel,' and 'support' encompasses pure political speech, then core free speech rights have been imperiled... We are not, and we must not become, a nation that imprisons and deports people because we are afraid of what they have to tell us."

The 161-page opinion includes extensive discussion of:
- The "unitary presidency" theory and its implications
- Use of masked federal agents to instill fear
- Weaponization of immigration enforcement for political purposes
- Presidential immunity preventing accountability

---

## Next Steps

**Remedy Hearing Scheduled:** Court will determine appropriate injunctive relief with these constraints:

- President Trump cannot be enjoined (separation of powers)
- Relief limited to subordinate officials and enforcement activities
- Cannot materially interfere with proper enforcement of immigration laws

---

## Significance

This represents one of the first successful challenges to Trump administration policies targeting protected speech through immigration enforcement. The detailed factual findings and explicit recognition of non-citizens' First Amendment rights establish important precedent, particularly given similar cases proceeding in other circuits (Second Circuit, Fourth Circuit, D.C. Circuit).
