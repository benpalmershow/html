**Posted on July 2, 2025**

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, or H.R. 1, passed the U.S. House on May 22, 2025, by a 215-214 vote and the Senate on July 1, 2025, by a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. This budget reconciliation package allocates significant funds for homeland security and immigration enforcement, prioritizing border security and mass deportation. Below is an overview of the key funding allocations based on the latest information.

## Key Funding Allocations

**Border Security and Infrastructure:** $46.5 billion for an integrated border barrier system (border wall, fencing, water barriers, access roads, and sensors), $5 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, and $4.1 billion to hire over 8,000 new CBP and Border Patrol agents.

**Immigration Enforcement and Detention:** $45 billion to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention capacity to over 100,000 beds daily, including family residential centers. $29.9 billion supports ICE enforcement operations, such as community arrests and state/local law enforcement cooperation, with $14.4 billion for transportation and removal of up to one million individuals annually.

**Personnel Expansion:** $10 billion to hire 10,000 additional ICE officers and support staff by 2029, including $858 million for retention bonuses and $600 million for recruitment.

**Immigration Courts:** $3.3 billion to the Department of Justice, with a portion for the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to address court backlogs, though limited to 800 immigration judges.

## Impact and Concerns

The OBBBA allocates approximately **$170 billion** for homeland security and immigration enforcement over four years, a significant increase from prior budgets. Supporters argue it strengthens border security and enforces immigration laws, aligning with the administration's priorities. Critics, including immigration advocates, warn that the focus on enforcement over adjudication could exacerbate court backlogs (currently over 3.6 million cases) and raise humanitarian concerns due to expanded detention and deportation. The bill's passage remains contentious, with the House needing to approve the Senate's version, facing potential opposition from fiscal hawks over the bill's $3.3 trillion deficit increase over 10 years.
