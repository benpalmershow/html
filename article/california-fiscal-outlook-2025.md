# California's $18B Budget Deficit

>The state has $14 billion in reserves and could likely find additional capacity for budgetary borrowing, if needed. That said, at this point, the state has used over $20 billion in borrowing, one‑time and temporary spending solutions are exhausted, and budget reserves are at about half of their peak. As it stands—with larger forecasted deficits and many fewer tools available to address them—California’s budget is undeniably less prepared for downturns.

**2026-27 Deficit:** $18B

**2027-28+ Deficit:** $35B/year

California's revenue growth is being **fully consumed by mandatory spending** (Prop 98 schools/colleges and Prop 2 reserves/debt).

**Why revenues can't fix this:**
- Prop 98 schools/colleges: Auto-scales with revenue increases
- Prop 2 reserves/debt: Auto-scales with revenue increases
- Together: Consume ~$10B of $11B revenue gain

**Spending growth outpaces revenue:**
- Health/Human Services: +5.9%/year
- Education: +5.5%/year
- Natural Resources: +16.8%/year (wildfire/climate)

California has already deployed:
- Rainy day fund drawdowns
- Debt deferrals
- One-time revenue measures
- Spending cuts

**Structural deficit** (2027-28+): $35B/year

LAO forecast assumes **no recession**. If economy weakens:
- Income tax revenue collapses (stock-dependent)
- Sales tax stagnates
- Real deficit could exceed $35B baseline
