# CA CEQA Reforms

**Posted on July 2, 2025**

On June 30, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom signed two landmark bills, **Assembly Bill (AB) 130** and **Senate Bill (SB) 131**, reforming the **California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)** to tackle the state's housing crisis and accelerate development. Below is a concise look at how these laws reshape CEQA.

---

## AB 130: Streamlining Infill Housing

Exempts most **infill housing projects** (built in already-developed urban areas) from CEQA's environmental review process, provided they comply with local zoning and planning standards.

Imposes a **30-day deadline** for agencies to approve or deny qualifying projects, speeding up housing construction.

Applies to projects under 85 feet, with no requirements for affordable housing or labor mandates.

## SB 131: Broadening CEQA Exemptions

Expands exemptions to include projects like **high-speed rail**, **wildfire mitigation**, **broadband**, and **advanced manufacturing** (e.g., semiconductor plants).

For housing projects missing CEQA exemptions due to a single condition, limits environmental reviews to only that specific issue, reducing delays and costs.

Exempts rezoning for state-approved housing plans.

## Impact and Controversy

These reforms aim to cut bureaucratic red tape, lower housing costs, and promote climate-friendly urban development. However, environmental groups argue they may weaken protections for wildlife, air, and water quality. Both laws took effect immediately, signaling a bold shift in balancing development and environmental oversight in California.
