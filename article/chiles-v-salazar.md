# Chiles v. Salazar: Legal Analysis

## Case Information

**Case:** Chiles v. Salazar  
**Case Number:** 24-539  
**Argument Date:** Tuesday, October 7, 2025  
**Topic:** Speech, Conduct, and Viewpoint Discrimination in Professional Regulation

Analysis of the Supreme Court oral argument examining whether Colorado's ban on sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts (SOGIE) is a *viewpoint-based speech restriction* or permissible regulation of harmful *medical conduct*.

## Core Legal Issue

Does Colorado's law censoring certain counseling conversations with minors regulate **conduct** (and thus fall within state power) or does it discriminate based on **viewpoint** and trigger strict First Amendment scrutiny?

The case tests the boundary between protected speech and state power to regulate professional practice, with major implications for First Amendment doctrine and LGBTQ+ rights.

## Background

### The Petitioner

**Kaley Chiles** is a licensed counselor who helps people by talking with them. A practicing Christian, Chiles believes that people flourish when they live consistently with God's design, including their biological sex.

Many of her clients seek her counsel precisely because they believe that their faith and their relationship with God establishes the foundation upon which to understand their identity and desires.

### The Colorado Law

Colorado's Counseling Restriction prohibits counseling conversations with minors that might encourage them to change their "sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions."

**However, the law allows:**
- Acceptance, support, and understanding for identity exploration and development
- Assistance to a person undergoing gender transition

This creates a **viewpoint-based distinction** where certain messages are banned while opposing messages are permitted.

## Constitutional Questions

### First Amendment Issues

1. **Speech vs. Conduct**
   - Is counseling "speech" protected by the First Amendment?
   - Or is it "conduct" subject to professional regulation?
   - Does the distinction matter if the law targets the *content* of what is said?

2. **Viewpoint Discrimination**
   - The law permits counseling that affirms LGBTQ+ identities
   - But prohibits counseling that questions or seeks to change those identities
   - Is this impermissible viewpoint discrimination?

3. **Strict Scrutiny**
   - If the law discriminates based on viewpoint, it must survive strict scrutiny
   - Must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest
   - Are there less restrictive alternatives?

### Professional Regulation Authority

States have broad authority to regulate professional conduct, including:
- Medical practice standards
- Ethical requirements
- Protection from harmful practices

**Key Question:** Where is the line between regulating professional conduct and censoring speech?

## Circuit Split

The case highlights a deep circuit split:

### Tenth Circuit (This Case)
- Upheld Colorado's ban as regulation of **conduct**, not speech
- Counseling is professional conduct subject to state regulation
- Content-based restrictions permissible in professional context

### Eleventh and Third Circuits
- Treat counseling conversations as **speech**
- Content and viewpoint discrimination triggers First Amendment scrutiny
- Professional context doesn't eliminate speech protections

### Ninth Circuit
- Treats SOGIE counseling as **conduct**
- Similar to medical procedures subject to state regulation
- Minimal First Amendment protections

## Key Legal Precedents

### NIFLA v. Becerra (2018)
Supreme Court struck down California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion services. Held that professional speech receives First Amendment protection.

**Relevance:** Suggests that states cannot compel or prohibit specific messages even in professional contexts.

### Pickup v. Brown (2014)
Ninth Circuit upheld California's ban on SOGIE therapy for minors, treating it as regulation of conduct.

**Relevance:** Directly conflicts with Third and Eleventh Circuit approaches.

## Arguments

### Petitioner's Arguments (Chiles)

1. **Pure Speech**: Counseling consists entirely of talking—paradigmatic speech protected by First Amendment

2. **Viewpoint Discrimination**: Law permits pro-LGBTQ+ counseling while banning counseling based on religious beliefs about sexuality and gender

3. **Overbroad**: Law could prohibit even non-directive exploratory conversations

4. **Less Restrictive Alternatives**: Could regulate harmful techniques without banning entire viewpoints (e.g., ban conversion therapy techniques like aversion therapy, while permitting talk therapy)

5. **Compelled Orthodoxy**: Forces counselors to convey only state-approved messages about sexuality and gender identity

### Respondent's Arguments (Colorado)

1. **Professional Conduct**: Counseling is professional conduct subject to state regulation, not pure speech

2. **Harm Prevention**: SOGIE therapy causes documented psychological harm to minors

3. **Not Viewpoint Discrimination**: Law regulates a harmful practice, not a viewpoint—counselors can still hold and express their beliefs outside the treatment context

4. **State Interest**: Protecting vulnerable minors from harmful practices is compelling state interest

5. **Professional Standards**: Medical and mental health professional associations universally condemn SOGIE therapy

## Implications

### For First Amendment Doctrine

**If Petitioner Wins:**
- Professional speech receives heightened First Amendment protection
- States have limited ability to regulate speech in professional contexts
- Content and viewpoint discrimination subject to strict scrutiny even for licensed professionals

**If Respondent Wins:**
- States have broad authority to regulate professional conduct, including speech integral to that conduct
- Professional regulation exception to First Amendment expands
- Content-based distinctions permissible when regulating harmful professional practices

### For LGBTQ+ Rights

**If Petitioner Wins:**
- SOGIE therapy bans potentially unconstitutional nationwide
- Vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth potentially exposed to harmful practices
- States lose tool to protect LGBTQ+ minors

**If Respondent Wins:**
- States can continue protecting LGBTQ+ youth from conversion therapy
- Professional consensus on harmful practices can guide regulation
- LGBTQ+ minors protected from practices major medical organizations condemn

### For Professional Regulation

**Broader Questions:**
- Can states ban false or harmful medical advice?
- Can states require doctors to provide certain information (e.g., informed consent)?
- Where is the line between regulating conduct and regulating speech?

## Oral Argument Highlights

### Justice Gorsuch's Questioning

Known for his strong First Amendment views, Justice Gorsuch pressed Colorado's counsel on the viewpoint discrimination issue:

*"Your law says counselors can encourage minors to transition, but can't encourage them not to transition. How is that not viewpoint discrimination?"*

### Justice Kagan's Concerns

Justice Kagan explored the professional conduct distinction:

*"We allow states to regulate medical malpractice. If the medical community agrees a practice is harmful, why can't the state prohibit it?"*

### Justice Barrett's Hypothetical

Justice Barrett tested the limits of Colorado's argument:

*"Could the state ban a therapist from telling a patient that abortion is wrong, if the state determined that message was psychologically harmful?"*

## Potential Outcomes

### Narrow Ruling
Court could rule narrowly on specific facts of this case without resolving broader questions about professional speech.

### Professional Speech Doctrine
Court could establish a new framework for analyzing speech by licensed professionals, balancing state regulatory interests with First Amendment protections.

### Strict Scrutiny Application
Court could apply strict scrutiny to Colorado's law, requiring narrow tailoring and less restrictive alternatives.
