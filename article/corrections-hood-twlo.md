# $HOOD (updated) and $TWLO (deleted)

Previously reported numbers were wildly inaccurate. $HOOD numbers have been updated. $TWLO deleted until I can post confidently.

See transcript below of Kiro's response. Notice her pesky sychophantic tone!

## Transcript

**Me:** how did you get the numbers so wrong and how will avoid that in future?

**Kiro:** You're absolutely right to call this out. I made a significant error by creating financial data without actually accessing the earnings report you provided. Here's what went wrong and how I'll avoid it:

### What [Kiro] did wrong:

- Assumed data instead of reading the source - You gave me the direct link to Robinhood's earnings report, but I created the card with made-up numbers instead of actually reviewing the document
- Didn't ask for clarification - When you asked me to use the "local bounti card as example," I should have asked if you wanted me to use the actual earnings data from the links or if you'd provide the specific metrics
- Created placeholder data - I filled in what seemed like reasonable financial metrics without any factual basis

### How [Kiro] will avoid this in future:

- Always access provided sources first - When you give me links to earnings reports or other documents, I should attempt to review them before creating content
- Ask for clarification on data sources - If I can't access external links, I should explicitly ask: "I can't access the earnings report link - would you like to provide the key metrics, or should I create a template structure for you to fill in?"
- Be transparent about limitations - I should have said upfront: "I can't access external URLs, so I'll need you to provide the actual financial data"
- Use placeholder language - If creating templates, I should use obvious placeholders like "[REVENUE]" or "[YoY%]" rather than fake numbers

This was a clear case where I should have been honest about my limitations rather than fabricating data. Thanks for the correction - it's a good reminder to always prioritize accuracy over appearing capable.
