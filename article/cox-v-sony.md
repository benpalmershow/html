## Core Legal Issue

The Supreme Court is examining whether **Cox Communications** can be held liable for copyright infringement committed by its internet subscribers. The case tests the boundaries of **secondary liability** under copyright law and the scope of **safe harbor protections** provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

**Key Question:** Does Cox's failure to terminate repeat infringers' accounts constitute **contributory infringement**, or is the company protected by the DMCA's safe harbor provisions?
