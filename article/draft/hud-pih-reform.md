# Four Steps to Abolish HUD PIH 

The federal role in housing should be limited. The optimization of a $50 trillion residential real estate market where 67% of American families hold their life savings should not fall under the purview of bureaucrats. Historical efforts to enact incremental reforms at PIH (Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act of 2016, ARRA, QHWRA, HOTMA, etc.) have only increased the size of the Federal Register; they have not produced results for the American public.

Shelter costs increased 4.4% YoY and account for a third of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Home sales are at their lowest in 30 years. 170,000 Californians are unhoused. These metrics demonstrate the failure of the current bureaucratic approach to housing policy.

## De-Proceduralization

We can reinvigorate and simplify a sclerotic and unimaginative HUD bureaucracy by abolishing PIH. The workforce is bloated and unproductive. By streamlining housing payments using modern technology, the public can allocate federal outlays more effectively by giving agency to DOGE.

Without PIH, we can support underserved communities, ensure access to and increase the production of affordable housing, promote homeownership, and advance sustainable communities much more efficiently.

## Step 1: Modernize Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program

Convert the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program to an IRS Tax credit or a negative income tax, remitted monthly to the recipient's bank account. Streamline Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) directly from the Treasury to the tenant. Integrate the HUD-50058 (Tenant File) with the IRS-1040 to maintain a blockchain ledger with the Treasury. Automate and validate monthly escrow payments. Reduce administrative costs by utilizing AI-assisted state-of-the-art software.

Correlate local housing market data with the tenant file to determine appropriate subsidy amount and program eligibility. For example: X family's W2×30%/12 = total tenant payment (TTP). Local Fair Market Rent (FMR) = Payment Standard (PS) or maximum subsidy.

Limit eligibility to qualified families under 50% of Area Median Income. Elderly and disabled individuals are prioritized. Non-elderly and non-disabled subsidies sunset after 5 years freeing up spots for applicants on 20+ year waitlists. Broaden eligibility as program efficiencies are realized.

**Cost Savings:** $2,931,345,607 in annual HCV admin fees. Unenumerated program costs savings.

## Step 2: Leverage Modern Technology for Data-Proven Cash Transfers

Leverage modern technology to support data-proven cash transfers that ameliorate poverty in the U.S. Ensure robust ID verification, eliminate self-certification, employ agentic AI and blockchain to incorporate dynamic real-time feedback. Restore public trust with full data transparency.

**Cost Savings:** $5,367,000,000 in current unreported income. $11,382,059.26 in debts owed to PHAs (that's just 1 out of 10 regions). $1,900,000,000 in annual HUD S&E.

## Step 3: Dispose Section 9 Assets and Cancel Annual Contributions Contracts

Dispose Section 9 Assets (Public Housing) and cancel all Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs). Recurring payments through the Capital Fund Program (CFP) and the Operating Fund (OpFund) do not trickle down to the tenant and add to administrative overhead.

Current RAD and Section 18 repositioning effort is slow, onerous, and complicated (see ARF and DDTF calculations as examples).

**Cost Savings:** $115,000,000,000 in projected capital needs, $3,175,322,791 in annual CFP, $5,423,168,540 in annual OpFund, billions in proceeds from quick sale at FMV of all PHA Land (FDS BLI 161) and Buildings (FDS BLI 162), climate resiliency with increased mobility and reduced exposure to projected 29% insurance premium increases due in the next 30 years.

## Step 4: Rescind Moving To Work Authority

Rescind Moving To Work (MTW) authority, recapture their reserves and return excess HUD funds to the Treasury.

MTW authority equates to less scrutiny under the auspices of flexibility. Their utilization rates are 86%, well below non-MTW standards.

MTW agencies use Safe Harbor waivers to justify increased expenditures with dubious Hardship policies that circumvent statutory budget-neutral requirements. MTW agencies can elect to pay 150% of FMR creating unfair competition in local housing markets. MTW agencies can employ social engineering and exclude specific income sources (UBI) from rent calculation.

MTW agencies sit on $1,089,604,001 in unused reserves and use it as their retirement slush fund. Philadelphia Housing Authority for example has $296,139,365 in total MTW HCV reserves which represents 97% of its Annual Budget Authority.

**Cost Savings:** $7,546,359,137 in MTW Budget Authority (BA). $1,089,604,001 in recaptured MTW HCV reserves.
