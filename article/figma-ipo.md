## Business Model Deep Dive

### What is Figma?

Figma is a **browser-based collaborative design platform** that enables teams to:
- Create user interfaces and digital products
- Collaborate in real-time (like Google Docs for design)
- Prototype and test designs
- Share design systems across organizations
- Integrate with development workflows

### The Problem Figma Solves

**Traditional Design Tools (Adobe Illustrator, Sketch):**
- Desktop-only (no collaboration)
- File-based versioning (conflicts, confusion)
- Slow designer-developer handoff
- Expensive per-seat licensing
- No real-time feedback

**Figma's Solution:**
- Browser-based (works anywhere)
- Real-time collaboration (multiplayer design)
- Single source of truth (no version conflicts)
- Developer-friendly (inspect code, export assets)
- Freemium model (viral adoption)

### Revenue Model

**1. Subscription Revenue (~90%)**
- **Professional Plan:** $12/editor/month (billed annually)
- **Organization Plan:** $45/editor/month (advanced features)
- **Enterprise Plan:** Custom pricing (SSO, security, support)

**2. Education/Non-Profit (Free)**
- Strategic investment in future users
- Builds brand loyalty and network effects

**3. Figma Make (AI Features)**
- Premium tier for AI-powered design assistance
- Potential for usage-based pricing
- Early days, but high margin potential

### Customer Acquisition Strategy

**Viral, Bottom-Up Adoption:**
1. **Free tier** attracts individual designers
2. **Collaboration** requires teammates to join
3. **Network effects** - more users = more value
4. **Department adoption** - design teams standardize on Figma
5. **Enterprise upsell** - IT/procurement finalizes contracts

**Result:** Low customer acquisition cost (CAC) relative to traditional enterprise sales

---

## Risk Factors

### High Risk: Intense Competition

**Adobe XD:**
- $20B acquisition blocked, but Adobe still owns design category
- Could aggressively price/bundle XD with Creative Cloud
- Deep pockets, large installed base

**Canva:**
- Expanding from consumer/SMB into enterprise
- Strong brand, easy-to-use
- Valued at $40B (private) - well-funded

**Mitigation:**
- Figma's collaborative-first architecture differentiated
- Network effects and switching costs provide moat
- AI roadmap (Figma Make) ahead of competitors

### Medium Risk: Economic Downturn

**Scenario:**
- Recession hits → companies cut discretionary spend
- Design software viewed as "nice-to-have" vs. essential
- Enterprise deals slow, seat expansion pauses

**Historical Context:**
- SaaS held up better than software in 2008-2009
- Cloud tools gained share during COVID (work-from-home)

**Mitigation:**
- Freemium model provides resilience (users won't churn if free)
- Collaboration tools sticky even in downturns
- International expansion diversifies risk

### Medium Risk: Regulatory (AI Training Data)

**Issue:**
- Figma trains AI on user-generated design files
- Copyright/IP concerns if data not properly consented
- Lawsuits against AI companies (OpenAI, Stability AI, etc.)

**Mitigation:**
- Figma owns platform, has ToS covering data use
- Developing proprietary datasets to reduce risk
- Regulatory clarity improving (EU AI Act, US guidelines)

### Low Risk: Valuation Multiple Compression

**Scenario:**
- Public market SaaS multiples compress (macro, rates, sentiment)
- Figma's 25x P/S falls to 15x (in line with peers)
- Stock underperforms despite good execution

**Mitigation:**
- Positive FCF provides downside support
- Path to profitability reduces risk vs. unprofitable peers
- Strategic value (potential acquirer premium)
