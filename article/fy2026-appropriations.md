### FY2026 Appropriations: $1.639T Budget with Major Workforce Cuts

By January 30, the Senate passed five of the 12 fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills on a bipartisan 71-29 vote, totaling **$1.639 trillion** in net base discretionary spending. The package also includes a two-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security to allow time for further negotiations. That's **$38.6 billion more** than FY2025, driven partially offset by a **10% federal workforce cut** and **$11.7 billion clawed back** from the IRS.

- Labor-HHS-Education (protections kept most public health intact)
- Homeland Security (FEMA boost of $4.7 billion)

**Losers:**
- State Department (2.5% cut in foreign operations and diplomacy)

- Corporation for Public Broadcasting (eliminated entirely)

#### The DOGE Effect

The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency left its mark, though Congress didn't go as far as requested:

| Reform | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Federal Workforce** | 10% reduction (est. $20B+ savings) |
| **IRS Funding** | Additional $11.7B clawed back |
| **NIH Cuts** | Congress rejected 40% cut; agency got $415M increase instead |
| **CDC Cuts** | Congress rejected 50% cut; maintained current funding |
| **BARDA** | Received full $1B despite Trump request for 36% cut |

Congress also imposed minimum staffing requirements at Social Security, Labor, Education, and HHS to prevent reorganizations without legislative approval.
