# IQ Scores and the Death Penalty

**Case:** John Q. Hamm, Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections v. Joseph Clifton Smith  
**Case Number:** 24-872  
**Oral Argument Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Duration:** Approximately 2 hours

---

## The Question

Whether and how courts may consider the cumulative effect of multiple IQ scores—along with evidence of adaptive functioning and other cognitive impairments—in assessing whether a death row inmate qualifies for protection under the Eighth Amendment's ban on executing individuals with intellectual disabilities.

---

## Background

Joseph Clifton Smith was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Alabama in 1997 for a killing committed during a robbery. At the time of his conviction, testing determined that Smith "performed math at the level of a kindergarten-aged child, spelled at a third-grade level, and read at a fourth-grade level." Throughout his childhood and early education, Smith struggled significantly, receiving scores of 74 and 75 on initial IQ tests, eventually placed in special education, and dropped out after failing seventh and eighth grade.

In the decades following his sentencing, the Supreme Court issued two foundational rulings:

1. **_Atkins v. Virginia_ (2002):** Held that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment bars execution of individuals with intellectual disabilities. The Court left it to states to define intellectual disability.

2. **_Hall v. Florida_ (2014):** Ruled that states cannot rely on a rigid IQ cutoff (Florida's rule of 70 or below) as dispositive. "Intellectual disability is a condition, not a number." States must consider evidence holistically, including adaptive functioning.

**The Complication:** Over nearly 40 years, Smith underwent five separate IQ tests, scoring 72, 74, 74, 75, and 78. While only one score (72) falls below Alabama's operative threshold of 70 (when accounting for the standard margin of error of +/- 5 points), all scores cluster near the border. Smith's trial court found him competent to stand trial. Federal courts, however, have since considered evidence of his lifelong cognitive and adaptive deficits—school performance two to four years below grade level, diagnosis of mental retardation (at that time) in seventh grade, functional reading and math at elementary levels, and multiple arrests and incarcerations reflecting poor social judgment.

**Lower Court Rulings:** Both the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Smith qualifies as intellectually disabled under _Atkins_, based on a "holistic approach" that considered his multiple IQ scores, adaptive functioning deficits, and developmental history—not simply his lowest score. Alabama sought Supreme Court review.

---

## The Arguments

**Alabama (Solicitor General Robert Overing):** Overing argued that Smith has not "come close to proving an IQ of 70 or below." (Tr. p. 8) The lower courts have "changed the rules" and "expanded _Atkins_" by elevating non-IQ evidence above the critical threshold. Alabama law requires that IQ be the primary measure of intellectual disability; other evidence may supplement but cannot override IQ results. Overing urged the Court to reverse this "expansion" and clarify that states may require a more rigorous showing of low IQ.

**United States (Assistant to the Solicitor General Harry Graver):** Graver contended that _Atkins_ "outsourced the definition of intellectual ability to the states," giving them "significant discretion." (Tr. p. 15) He argued that Alabama's approach—requiring that Smith's "true IQ is likely 70 or below based on all relevant evidence, including his multiple IQ scores all above 70"—represents a reasonable exercise of that discretion. The lower courts impermissibly weighed adaptive functioning evidence to override the preponderance of IQ testing, in the government's view.

**Joseph Clifton Smith (Seth Waxman, Counsel):** Waxman argued that Alabama law, like that of nearly all other states, requires courts to evaluate all probative evidence of intellectual functioning. (Tr. p. 22) When multiple IQ scores cluster near the threshold and expert testimony establishes that those scores alone don't decide the issue, courts must consider comprehensive evidence—including neuropsychological tests, grade school records showing years of below-average performance, and functional deficits. Waxman maintained that the lower courts properly applied established law in finding Smith intellectually disabled.

## Justice Positions

**Skeptical of Smith's Claim:**
- **Justice Neil Gorsuch:** Proposed a test under which states need "a little leeway" to determine whether a defendant has "substantial subaverage intellectual function" as long as they don't treat a single low-70s score as "decisive" and don't "use facts extraneous to IQ scores to outweigh a low score." (Tr. pp. 32-34) His framing appeared to privilege IQ evidence and skepticism toward adaptive functioning as a decisive factor.

**Sympathetic to Smith's Holistic Approach:**
- **Justice Sonia Sotomayor:** Questioned whether Alabama's position was tenable, noting that Alabama's "own expert said he had valid scores between 72 and 78 and he relied on all of the other indicia to determine that he believed this person wasn't intellectually disabled"—while Smith's experts "concluded differently, and the district court credited" their conclusions. (Tr. pp. 27-28) Her questions suggested that the state's own testimony supported a holistic inquiry.

- **Justice Amy Coney Barrett:** Pressed Alabama on whether it truly ignores adaptive functioning evidence. "It seems to me that Justice Sotomayor is right that there are some Alabama cases that do move on" to consider adaptive functioning. (Tr. p. 38) Her questions suggested openness to lower courts considering adaptive functioning evidence alongside IQ scores.

- **Justice Elena Kagan:** Proposed a potential test: "if you have one score that brings you into the 70 minus range, that's enough so that you have to … open the door to a person's evidence" regarding adaptive functioning. (Tr. p. 41) Her approach would appear to prevent states from simply dismissing non-IQ evidence when any score falls near the threshold.

**Potentially Pivotal:**
- **Justice Brett Kavanaugh:** Expressed skepticism of Alabama's rigid position, asking "[W]hat's the logic or the rationale behind not having a district court or a trial court or a state court [to] have the ability … to go on and look at more?" (Tr. p. 45) His questions suggested openness to lower courts considering broader evidence, though his ultimate voting position remained uncertain.

## Critical Hypotheticals and Tensions

**The Multiple Scores Problem:** If a defendant has four IQ scores of 90 and one score of 71, should courts be required to look at adaptive functioning? Waxman agreed "100 percent" that they would not necessarily have to do so, suggesting that courts could hear expert testimony concluding the defendant's IQ is sufficiently high that no further inquiry is needed. This suggests potential common ground on extreme cases but leaves unclear the treatment of Smith's scores (all within a narrow band near 70).

**Dicta vs. Holding:** Alabama argued that post-_Hall_ confusion arose from dicta (non-central language) in Supreme Court opinions, asserting that "there is not a case in which that other evidence has ever trumped IQ in Alabama." Waxman countered that Alabama law and nearly all state law require evaluation of "all probative evidence," implying that IQ alone cannot be conclusive when expert testimony suggests scores don't decide the issue.

**The Role of Modern Medical Standards:** Justice Gorsuch referenced the Court's decision in _Moore v. Texas_, which held that states should rely on modern medical standards (which emphasize adaptive functioning and contextual evidence) rather than outdated ones. Yet Alabama's current approach arguably de-emphasizes modern psychological understanding that intellectual disability is multifactorial.

---

## Likely Outcome

The court appeared divided. A potential narrow holding might allow states modest discretion in setting thresholds while requiring that, when IQ scores cluster near a defined cutoff (particularly 70 or just above), courts must consider credible evidence of adaptive functioning and developmental history. Justice Kavanaugh's openness to lower court discretion and Justice Sotomayor's emphasis on the state's own expert conceding a holistic inquiry suggested possible middle ground.

**Most likely scenario:** The Court will not simply defer to Alabama's rule requiring IQ scores below 70 absent extraordinary circumstances. Instead, it may clarify that _Hall v. Florida_ and modern diagnostic standards (which emphasize adaptive functioning) remain binding and that lower courts have discretion to find intellectual disability based on comprehensive evidence when scores cluster near the threshold—but that states retain authority to set reasonable evidentiary standards for what constitutes sufficient proof.

**Stakes:** The outcome affects capital cases nationwide and the underlying question of how courts balance quantitative metrics (IQ tests) against qualitative, multi-factor evidence of cognitive and adaptive impairment in determining fundamental constitutional protections.
