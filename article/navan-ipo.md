## Key Questions for Investors

### 1. Can Navan Reach Profitability?

**Path Forward:**
- Need to sustain 30%+ revenue growth
- Maintain 68%+ gross margins (AI leverage critical)
- Control sales/marketing spend as a % of revenue

**Timeline:** 2-3 years to GAAP profitability likely

### 2. How Defensible is the Moat?

**Strong:**
- Vertical integration = high switching costs
- Proprietary AI = hard to replicate
- Network effects from platform adoption

**Weak:**
- Large competitors (Concur) could modernize
- Fintech unicorns (Brex, Ramp) expanding into travel
- No true lock-in if customer wants to leave

### 3. What Happens in a Recession?

**Historical Context:**
- 2008-2009: Corporate travel down 30%+
- 2020: COVID crushed travel (Navan pivoted to survive)

**Navan's Response:**
- Expense management less cyclical than travel
- Payment revenue more stable
- But core travel business highly exposed

### 4. Is the Valuation Fair?

**At 10x P/S:**
- Reasonable for 30%+ growth with improving margins
- Risky if growth slows or recession hits
- Compare to comps and reassess after 1-2 quarters public

---

Navan represents a **high-risk, high-reward opportunity** in the corporate spend management space. The company has:

**Strong product** - Clear differentiation vs. legacy tools
**AI advantage** - Proprietary technology driving margin expansion
**Market opportunity** - Large TAM, fragmented competition

**Still unprofitable** - Needs multiple years to break even
