# War Bill

The **National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026** is a massive bill - about **3,100 pages** long. The Senate took the executive branch's $20.84 billion shipbuilding request and authorized $30.96 billion instead, a $10.1 billion increase to build more destroyers.

The increase centers on the DDG–51 guided-missile destroyer program—the Navy's workhorse for force projection—and introduces an explicit new line item: $5.4 billion in "wage and quality of life enhancements" for shipyard workers and industrial base infrastructure. That category did not exist in the executive request. It is a direct congressional statement that the shipbuilding industrial base is underfunded relative to production demand.

| Item (SEC. 4101) | FY2026 Request | Senate Authorized | Change | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| CVN Refueling Overhauls | $1,779,011,000 | $1,779,011,000 | — | Carriers held at requested level |
| DDG 1000 | $52,358,000 | $52,358,000 | — | Next-gen destroyer line held steady |
| DDG–51 | $10,773,000 | $6,335,173,000 | +$6,324,400,000 | Baseline plus $5.3B in add-ons (see below) |
| Wage & quality of life enhancements — surface shipbuilding, ship repair, public/private yards | n/a | $5,400,000,000 | +$5,400,000,000 | **New line item under DDG–51** |
| Wage & quality of life enhancements (additional) | n/a | $924,400,000 | +$924,400,000 | Bracketed add-on under DDG–51 |
| DDG–51 (zero-request line item) | — | $1,350,000,000 | +$1,350,000,000 | Separate DDG–51 authorized line |
| DDG–51 Advance Procurement | n/a | $900,000,000 | +$900,000,000 | Bracketed add-on |
| Large Surface Combatant Shipyard Infrastructure & Industrial Base | n/a | $450,000,000 | +$450,000,000 | Bracketed add-on |
| TAGOS SURTASS Ships | $612,205,000 | $612,205,000 | — | Surveillance ships held steady |
| Outfitting | $863,846,000 | $886,846,000 | +$23,000,000 | Minor increase |
| Service Craft | $34,602,000 | $174,602,000 | +$140,000,000 | YRBM procurement boost |
| **Total Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy** | **$20,840,224,000** | **$30,957,624,000** | **+$10,117,400,000** | **48.5% increase** |


The Senate increased the destroyer account from $10.8 million (request) to $6.34 billion (authorized)—a 58-fold expansion.

Congress created two new, labeled line items totaling $6.3 billion that did not exist in the Pentagon request:
- $5.4 billion for "Wage and quality of life enhancements for conventional surface shipbuilding, private ship repair, and public shipyards"
- $924.4 million for additional wage and quality of life enhancements
- $450 million for "Large Surface Combatant Shipyard Infrastructure and Industrial Base"

This is money to keep shipyard workers employed, competitive, and to upgrade the infrastructure that builds the ships. Congress is betting that the binding constraint on naval force expansion is not design or political will, but human and industrial capacity.

Carrier refueling overhauls, the next-generation DDG 1000, and surveillance ships all held at the Pentagon's request level. Congress prioritized destroyer capacity expansion and industrial base resilience, not fleet diversity.

The Pentagon is underfunded for the naval industrial commitments Congress believes are necessary. A 48.5% increase in total authorization signals no mere adjustment—it is a fundamental disagreement about resource allocation. The creation of explicit workforce investment line items, rather than burying those costs in ship prices, indicates congressional intention to treat shipyard employment and facility upgrade as strategic assets that transcend individual platforms.

Beyond shipbuilding, the 3,100-page bill includes some specific technology requirements:

- **Artificial Intelligence oversight**: Creates an "Artificial General Intelligence Steering Committee" and requires "Artificial intelligence model assessment and oversight." (S. 2296, Sec. 1623, p. 23)
- **Quantum readiness**: Requires the Department of Defense to develop a "Strategy on quantum readiness." (S. 2296, Sec. 6611, p. 31)  
- **AI in anti-money laundering**: Requires a "Report on implementation of artificial intelligence into certain anti-money laundering investigations." (S. 2296, Sec. 6032, p. 29)
