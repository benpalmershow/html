## What Are Kei Trucks?

Kei trucks, also known as Japanese mini trucks, are lightweight utility vehicles originally manufactured in Japan. They feature small dimensions—typically under 10 feet long and 5 feet wide—and engines of 660cc or less, making them fuel-efficient and ideal for navigating rural roads, job sites, and urban areas.

These vehicles are widely used in agriculture, construction, fishing, and municipal services across Asia. In the U.S., they're gaining popularity among farmers, hunters, contractors, and small business owners for their affordability (often $4,000–$15,000) and versatility, serving as alternatives to ATVs, UTVs, and larger pickups.

The bill defines Kei trucks based on size, age, and engine capacity, allowing registration for a standard $63 fee. It establishes a maximum fine of $1,000 for unlawful on-road use, bringing Oregon in line with neighboring states like Washington and Idaho, where Kei trucks are already permitted.

“Small businesses, farmers, and Oregonians across our state are asking for practical, cost-effective transportation options,” Sen. Broadman stated. “Kei trucks are nimble, fuel-efficient, and ideal for navigating rural roads, job sites, and tight urban corridors.”
