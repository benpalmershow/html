### <i data-lucide='home' class='post-icon'></i> **NYC Audit Exposes $11M DocGo Asylum Housing Failure**

The New York City Comptroller's audit of the $432 million DocGo contract reveals systematic fiscal mismanagement and unsafe conditions in asylum seeker housing. Nearly 80% of a two-month sample in payments—$11 million of $13.8 million—lacked adequate documentation and should be recovered.

**Key Findings:**

- **Unsupported Payments**: $11 million (80%) of sampled May-June 2023 invoices were not adequately documented
- **Unauthorized Subcontractors**: 67% of claimed expenses went to subcontractors never approved by HPD
- **Vacant Rooms**: City paid $1.7 million for unoccupied hotel rooms
- **Housing Deficiencies**: 80% of 189 audited rooms had at least one deficiency; some posed serious health and safety hazards including mold, water damage, and peeling paint
- **Staffing Gaps**: DocGo failed to deploy the required number of caseworkers and social workers

The contract was awarded as an emergency no-bid measure in May 2023 after the rapid influx of asylum seekers. Despite the Comptroller's initial rejection, the city proceeded with the agreement.

**Agency Response:**

HPD partially agreed to recoup expenses and conduct additional invoice reviews, though it disagreed with some unallowable expense classifications. The agency committed to holding back a minimum 15% of remaining invoices and retroactively reviewing all subcontractors used by DocGo.
