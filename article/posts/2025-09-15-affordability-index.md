###  **Housing Affordability**

The Housing Affordability Index rebounded to 104.5 in September, marking a notable recovery from August's 100.6, signaling improved purchasing power for median-income families amid moderating mortgage rates and stable home prices.

**Latest Data:**
- **September**: 104.5 (+3.9 points MoM)
- **August**: 100.6 (-2.6 points MoM)

The substantial month-over-month gain reflects a decline in mortgage rates, which dropped below 6.3% in September from elevated levels earlier in the summer. An affordability index above 100 means a family with median income has excess purchasing power to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. This improvement provides a small reprieve to buyers after a period of compressed affordability, though values remain historically elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels when the index regularly exceeded 110.
