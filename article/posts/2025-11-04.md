## Burry's 13F Filing

Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management Q3 2025 13F filing, filed with the SEC on November 3, 2025, disclosed significant bearish positions in AI-related stocks, including put options on [Nvidia](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA) ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) valued at $186.58 million and [Palantir Technologies](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR) ([PLTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR)) at $912.10 million. These positions represent short bets against the companies, with NVDD (Direxion Daily NVDA Bear 1X Shares) also held as a bearish ETF on Nvidia. Burry had previously disclosed Nvidia puts in Q1 2025, noting they might hedge unreportable long positions, but the Q3 filing omitted this disclaimer, indicating a more direct bearish stance.

The market reacted sharply: Nvidia shares fell 3.96% to $198.69, while Palantir dropped 7.94% to $190.74 on November 4, 2025, amid concerns over AI valuations. Burry's social media warnings, including posts referencing bubbles and circular AI financing involving Nvidia and OpenAI, amplified the impact. His fund also added call options on [Halliburton](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HAL) ([HAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HAL)) and [Pfizer](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE) ([PFE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE)), and new equity positions in [Molina Healthcare](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MOH) ([MOH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MOH)), [SLM Corporation](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLM) ([SLM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLM)), and ProShares UltraPro QQQ ([PLTD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QLD)).
