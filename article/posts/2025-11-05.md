## October ADP Employment and Treasury Yield Update

Private sector employment increased by 42,000 jobs in October 2025 per ADP following a revised loss of 29,000 jobs in September. 
This marked a rebound from two months of weak hiring, though the gains were modest and not broad-based. The report highlighted strong growth in trade, transportation, and utilities (+47,000), education and health services (+26,000), and financial activities (+11,000), offset by losses in professional business services (-15,000), information (-17,000), and leisure and hospitality (-6,000).

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield average for October was 4.06% representing a 2 basis point decline from September's 4.08%. This move reflected growing market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, with yields pressured lower by dovish FOMC commentary and softening inflation data. The yield curve remained inverted, with the 2-year Treasury at 3.45%, though the spread narrowed slightly amid speculation of monetary policy easing.

## FOMC December Decision

Prediction markets show decreasing conviction for a 25 basis point Federal Reserve rate cut at the December FOMC meeting, with Kalshi and Polymarket aggregating probabilities at 65% for a quarter-point decrease versus 32% for no change. This shift in sentiment reflects mounting concerns over labor market cooling and below-target inflation readings, though market participants remain divided on the timing and magnitude of further cuts.

The entry questioned whether human agency remains irreplaceable in investment decisions, contrasting AI's data-driven approach with Warren Buffett's emphasis on long-term sagaciousness.
