## Agricultural Commodities Added to Financial Indicators

Added USDA NASS pricing data for two major agricultural commodities:

- **Soybeans**: 2025 YTD prices ranging $10.00–$10.40/bu
- **Wheat**: 2025 YTD prices ranging $4.84–$5.71/bu
The data shows wheat prices have declined from 2022's peak of $10.90/bu, but they've stabilized in the $5–$6 range recently.
