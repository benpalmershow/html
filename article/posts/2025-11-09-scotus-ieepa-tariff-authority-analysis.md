# SCOTUS Rules Against IEEPA Tariff Authority

<i data-lucide='gavel'></i>

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court invalidated the President's tariff program under IEEPA. The Court held that "regulate importation" cannot support revenue-raising tariffs without explicit congressional authorization, reasserting Congress's exclusive control over taxation under Article I.

Chief Justice Roberts wrote for a splintered majority in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* (2026).

## The Holding

IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The President had asserted unlimited tariff authority of any amount, duration, and scope on any product from any country. The Court rejected this reading.

Roberts emphasized that Congress always uses explicit language ("duties," "tariffs," "taxes") when delegating tariff authority in Sections 232, 301, and 201 of the Trade Acts. IEEPA's verbs describe embargo-style controls (block, nullify, prohibit), not taxation. Allowing implicit tariff authority would effect an improper "sweeping delegation of Congress's power to set tariff policy."

## The Fractured Majority

**Three justices** (Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson) held IEEPA does not authorize tariffs as ordinary statutory interpretation.

**Three justices** (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) applied the major questions doctrine, reasoning that while "regulate importation" could technically support tariffs, Congress must "clearly" delegate such "extraordinary" powers.

Both paths reach the same result.

## The Dissents

Justice Kavanaugh (joined by Thomas and Alito) argued ordinary statutory meaning of "regulate importation" includes tariffs, comparable to embargoes and quotas. He flagged the odd distinction: the President could ban all imports but apparently not impose a 1% tariff.

Kavanaugh noted other tariff statutes (Section 232, 201, 301) remain available, so the decision may not substantially constrain future tariff authority - just "the wrong statutory box."

## Refunds and Impact

Importers who paid IEEPA tariffs may be entitled to refunds of billions of dollars. The Government conceded the refund process would be "a mess," with complications from cost pass-through to consumers.
