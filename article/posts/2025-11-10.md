Solicitor General **Sauer's** argument carries a paradox at its core: **its success is measured not by what it collects, but by what it prevents.**
Each avoided payment, each concession extracted abroad, is framed as a regulatory win - proof that pressure works before the tariff ever takes effect.  

### The Theory

When foreign competitors believe tariffs could strike at any moment, they move preemptively:
- **Concede faster** in trade negotiations  
- **Accelerate** domestic or allied-country investment  
- **Alter** export behavior to avoid triggering penalties  

**In Sauer’s formulation, the tariff isn’t the objective—it’s the deterrent.**  
The real gain lies in *avoidance*: reshored manufacturing, faster settlements, and behavioral change achieved without revenue collection.

### The Paradox Ahead

If tariffs are “regulatory” only when **no one pays**, how does that logic hold once revenues are **collected and rebated**—as in the proposed **$2,000 household tariff credit**?  
Turning deterrence into redistribution risks transforming a *foreign-policy lever* into a *domestic tax program*, precisely the line Sauer’s argument seeks to avoid.
