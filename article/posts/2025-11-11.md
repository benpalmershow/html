When using AI, be sure to cite correct case or face disciplinary scrutiny for not meeting legal competence standards.

Kentucky clerk Kim Davis refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses, citing religious objections. She sought immunity; the court denied it.

Personal beliefs are irrelevant to official duties. When a public employee's conscience conflicts with statute, the law prevails. Davis was performing a ministerial function—issuing licenses under Kentucky law—with no discretion to inject personal theology.

**Qualified immunity** shields officials conducting **clearly established** sovereign business. It does not shelter personal objections to lawful duties. Davis had no immunity because:
1. Same-sex marriage rights were clearly established (*Obergefell*, 2015)
2. Issuing licenses is ministerial, not discretionary
3. Immunity protects officials from liability for legal judgment calls, not refusal to perform statutory duties

SCOTUS Update: [Supreme Court Oral Arguments Schedule - Updated](news.html)

**[LANDOR v. LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS (23-1197)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1197.html)**
Examines religious protections in institutional settings under RLUIPA and the Free Exercise Clause. Distinguishes between discretionary official acts (where immunity may apply) and ministerial duties bound by clearly established rights (where it does not).

**[GEO GROUP INC. v. MENOCAL (24-758)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-758.html)**
Tests derivative sovereign immunity under the *Yearsley* doctrine. Government contractors cannot claim immunity by proxy; conduct must have been specifically authorized and directed by the government. Immunity is narrow.

**Scenario**: $400,000 home purchase, 20% down payment ($80,000), financing $320,000

**Grok Calculation:**

| Term |  Payment |  Interest | Total Paid |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 30 years | $1,919 | $370,860 | $690,860 |
| 50 years | $1,684 | $690,400 | $1,010,400 |

**ChatGPT Calculation:**

| Term        |  Payment |  Interest | Total  Paid |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 30-year | $1,919.69   |$371,088                 |    $691,088   |
| 50-year | $1,708.31   | $704,986            |      $1,024,986   |

**Claude Calculation:**
| Term |  Payment |  Interest | Total Paid |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| 30-year   | $1,918.56      | $370,281.60    | $690,281.60 |
| 50-year   | $1,650.53      | $670,318.00    | $990,318.00 |

**The Problem**: A 50-year mortgage reduces monthly payments but significantly increases total interest paid. Borrowers pay substantially more over the life of the loan compared to a 30-year term.

**Verify the math**: Compare a [30-year mortgage](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-payment-calculator.php) with a 50-year term using [mortgagecalculator.org](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/)

**Dodd-Frank Act's Ability to Repay (ATR) rule** (12 CFR §1026.43) prohibits lenders from extending mortgage terms beyond 30 years. Under ATR, lenders must verify that borrowers have the capacity to repay loans based on documented income and expenses. 50-year mortgages are classified as non-qualified mortgages (Non-QM), exposing lenders to significant litigation risk and regulatory penalties. This legal restriction prevents predatory lending but also limits borrower flexibility in handling affordability crises.
