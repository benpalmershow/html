## 👩 More Births to Women >40 Than Teenagers

For the second consecutive year, more babies were born to women ages 40–44 (12.8 per 1,000) than to teenagers ages 15–19 (12.7 per 1,000) in 2024. This historic shift reflects delayed childbearing, better access to contraception, career prioritization, and advances in fertility medicine. Teen birth rates have declined 79% since 1991 while births to women 40+ have surged 193%.
