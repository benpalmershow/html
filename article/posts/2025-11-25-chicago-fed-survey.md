### **Chicago Fed Survey**

The Chicago Fed Survey of Economic Conditions Activity Index fell sharply to -3.92 in November, down from October's +17.33. The negative reading signals below-average growth in the Seventh District (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin).

**Latest Data:**
• **November**: -3.92 (-21.25 MoM)
• **October**: +17.33

The reversal suggests economic headwinds despite October's rebound. Negative values indicate regional business activity is contracting relative to historical averages.
