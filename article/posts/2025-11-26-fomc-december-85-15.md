Prediction markets are pricing an 85% chance the Federal Reserve cuts rates by 25 basis points at the December 10 meeting, with just 15% probability of holding steady.

**The Whipsaw**: Earlier in November, Fed officials signaled caution and markets priced in a pause at 70%+ probability. Traders braced for the Fed to hold and reassess during the shutdown. But weakening consumer sentiment (now at 51, the year's low) and persistent disinflation flipped the script. The 25BP cut zoomed back to 85% as traders recognized the Fed can't afford to stay idle when demand is softening. PPI (Producer Price Index) has stabilized around 149.8, showing persistent disinflation flowing through the supply chain without new price shocks emerging.
