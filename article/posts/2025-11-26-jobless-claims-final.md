### **Jobless Claims**

Initial jobless claims (seasonally adjusted, monthly average) fell to 217,600 in November, down from 226,750 in October, marking a meaningful improvement in labor market health. The decline suggests employers remain cautious with layoffs despite economic headwinds.

Claims below 300,000 typically indicate a resilient job market. The recent decline reinforces signals that employers are holding onto workers even as consumer sentiment remains fragile, keeping the labor market as one of the economy's strongest anchors.

### **Climate Denial**

<b>Nature</b> retracted a flawed climate study (Kotz et al.) that had been widely used in global financial regulation and policy, including by the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The retraction highlights the importance of rigorous methodology in informing major policy decisions affecting economic growth and interest rates. A single country's erroneous data—Uzbekistan—inflated the study's projections: when removed, global GDP damage estimates fell from 62% to 23% by 2100. Without climate skeptics scrutinizing research, studies like this would proceed unchecked, compromising the integrity of science itself.

The Trump administration is withholding federal SNAP administrative funding from Democratic-led states that refuse to submit recipient data (immigration status, SSN, etc.) requested under executive order. Supporters argue the data strengthens fraud detection; opponents cite privacy violations. A federal judge has blocked the USDA from denying funds based on non-compliance, but the administration intends to proceed.
