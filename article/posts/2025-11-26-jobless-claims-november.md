###  **Jobless Claims**

Initial jobless claims declined to 223,750 in November, down from 226,750 in October. The modest monthly decrease signals steady labor market conditions as hiring remains resilient despite broader economic uncertainty.

**Latest Data:**
-   **November**: 223,750 claims (-1.3% MoM)
-   **October**: 226,750 claims

**Why the Decline?**

Claims remain comfortably in the low-to-mid 220,000 range, well below the 300,000 threshold that typically signals labor market stress. The stable trend reflects resilient employment conditions heading into year-end, though the labor market remains measured rather than accelerating.
