###  **All Power Resides with the People**

Massachusetts' 1780 Declaration of Rights, penned by John Adams, establishes an unmistakable principle: <b>"All power residing originally in the people, and being derived from them, the several magistrates and officers of government, vested with authority, whether legislative, executive, or judicial, are their substitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them."</b>

###  **Pipe Bomber Identified**

On January 5, 2021, pipe bombs were placed at the RNC and DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C. The FBI identified <b>Brian J. Cole, Jr.</b>, a 30-year-old bail bondsman's office worker from Woodbridge, Virginia, through surveillance footage, financial records, and cell phone data.

**Evidence:**
Video shows the perpetrator placing the DNC bomb at 7:54 p.m. and RNC bomb at 8:16 p.m., wearing dark clothing, gloves, and Nike Speed Turf shoes. Between 2019-2020, Cole purchased pipes, end caps, 9V battery connectors, kitchen timers, electrical wire, and steel wool—all components matching the devices. Notably, he <b>continued purchasing identical parts after January 5</b>. Cell phone records pinged towers near South Capitol Street, D Street Southeast, and directly adjacent to the RNC—timeline and location matching the suspect's route. Cole's physical profile (5'6", corrective eyeglasses) matched the bomber's description from video surveillance.
