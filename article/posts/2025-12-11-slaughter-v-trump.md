## **Conclusive and Preclusive**


Solicitor General Sauer argued that the President possesses exclusive constitutional authority over executive officials and cannot be constrained by Congress through removal restrictions. Counsel Amit Agarwal countered that only powers that are truly conclusive and preclusive—such as control over criminal investigations per *Trump v. United States*—warrant removal authority. Most independent agencies exercise mixed powers (investigative, adjudicatory, rulemaking) that are not exclusively presidential, he argued, and thus removal protections remain constitutional. Justices pressed both sides on where to draw lines: Does criminal investigative authority alone trigger presidential control? If agencies control vast regulatory domains, does independent status survive?
