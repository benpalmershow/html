#    **Hamm v. Smith**

Hamm v. Smith examines whether courts must consider adaptive functioning and cognitive evidence alongside IQ scores when determining if a death row inmate qualifies for Eighth Amendment protection from execution. The case hinges on whether states can apply rigid numerical thresholds or must weigh comprehensive evidence of intellectual disability.

<b>The Question:</b> Joseph Clifton Smith scored 72-78 on five IQ tests over four decades, clustering near Alabama's 70 threshold. While only one score fell below 70, school records show he functioned years behind grade level and was diagnosed with mental retardation in seventh grade. Lower courts found him intellectually disabled; Alabama argues his IQ is simply too high.

<b>The Divide:</b> Justices Sotomayor, Barrett, and Kagan pressed Alabama on why adaptive functioning evidence matters so little when all indicia point toward intellectual disability. Justice Gorsuch sought middle ground—states need "leeway" but can't ignore disability claims outright. Justice Kavanaugh signaled openness to lower court discretion.

<b>The Stakes:</b> The ruling will clarify how Atkins v. Virginia (2002) and Hall v. Florida (2014) apply nationally, determining whether quantitative metrics (IQ tests) or holistic evidence (adaptive functioning, developmental history) controls in capital cases.
