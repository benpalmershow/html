The federal government has failed at urban renewal. Centralized planning with top-down directives has yielded disastrous results. Policies to intervene in low-cost neighborhoods and "reform" them have been abysmal. We now have established municipal funds to pay for their historical harm. Continued misallocation of funds will bankrupt cities and prove that upward mobility is best achieved through organic local development and that big ugly word CAPITAL. It may not be pretty, healthy, safe, and decent at times, but local wealth accumulation and self-determination is superior to social engineering driven by sophisticated academia and aloof bureaucrats. Mr. Husock demonstrates that the true path to opportunity rests in neighborhood self-determination and the individual entrepreneur.
