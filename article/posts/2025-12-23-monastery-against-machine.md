Paul Kingsnorth's new book dissects how technology and modern capitalism have reshaped humanity, offering a critique rooted in spiritual and economic analysis.
Meanwhile, billionaire Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Denver-based data analytics firm Palantir, purchases the 3,700-acre St. Benedict's Monastery in Old Snowmass, Colorado, for $120 million. The property, built in the 1950s by Trappist monks seeking a life of silence and prayer, will be converted to a private residence. The monastery sits on prime real estate featuring a 24,000-square-foot main building, three creeks, and senior water rights in the Roaring Fork Valley.

>'Want is the acid. Capitalism is the battery. Growth is the engine. Greed is the forming energy that moves us to where we are inevitably headed...Modernity is a machine for destroying limits.'
