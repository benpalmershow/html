### <i data-lucide='users' class='post-icon'></i> **California Faces $2.5 Billion CalFresh Bill**

Federal legislation enacted in July 2025 just handed California a major fiscal problem. Starting in federal fiscal year 2028, states will shoulder part of SNAP benefits costs—determined by their payment error rate (PER). California's 11 percent error rate means the state will pay 15 percent of its CalFresh costs if it doesn't improve. At current spending levels, that's nearly $1.8 billion annually in new benefit costs, plus another $600 million in administrative expenses. Total estimated impact: $2.5 billion per year.

**Payment Error Reductions**

California has struggled to lower its PER since federal fiscal year 2017, hovering around 11 percent—consistently above the 10 percent threshold that triggers the highest cost-sharing tier. According to the state auditor's December 2025 report, the largest source of CalFresh errors stems from inaccurate wage and salary reporting at application and recertification. County workers fail to capture participants' true earned income, or beneficiaries underreport earnings due to limited understanding of rules. The state already submits corrective action plans to federal regulators, but implementation remains slow. Recent state legislation provided funding for PER reduction work, yet Social Services stated it hasn't had time to hire additional staff or finalize specific strategies.

**A Timing Problem**

The OBBBA's cost-sharing formula takes effect in less than three years for federal fiscal year 2028, with the state's PER from FFY 2025 or 2026 determining the tier. If California doesn't substantially reduce its error rate in the next 18 months, it will begin writing very large checks. Even if the state lowers its PER to 8–10 percent, it will still owe 10 percent of CalFresh costs—roughly $1.2 billion annually. Against a projected $20 billion operating deficit for state fiscal year 2026–27, these new mandatory costs threaten both the CalFresh program and the state's broader budget balance.

### <i data-lucide='users' class='post-icon'></i> **Jobless Claims Rise Modestly in December**

Initial jobless claims averaged 225,000 for December, a slight uptick from November's 217,600. The reading remains below the 300,000 threshold typically associated with labor market stress, but the trend bears watching as the year closes.
