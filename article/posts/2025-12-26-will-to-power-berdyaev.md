### **The Sacred and the Profane**

From: <a href="media.html#against-the-machine">Against the Machine</a> by Paul Kingsnorth

>"The will to power, to wellbeing, to wealth, triumphs over the will to holiness and to genius. ... Spirituality is on the wane, [in] a time of bourgeois ascendancy. The knight and the monk, the philosopher and the poet, have been superseded by a new type the greedy bourgeois conqueror, organizer, and trader ... In the new machine-made industrial-capitalist civilization of Europe and America, the spiritual culture ... based on a sacred symbolism and sacred tradi-tion, is being irrevocably annihilated." - **Nikolai Berdyaev**, *The Bourgeois Mind and Other Essays* (The Stanhope Press, 1934)

**The Annihilation of Tradition**

The Machine doesn't just displace the sacred with the material. It replaces inquiry with ideology, reporting with advocacy. When UC Berkeley academics defend welfare expansion not through rigorous analysis but through appeals to moral righteousness, when federal fraud investigations are ignored because they contradict a preferred narrative, we're witnessing exactly what Berdyaev diagnosed: the complete annihilation of any tradition that values truth-telling over tribal solidarity.

The bourgeois mind, once purely materialist, has been supplanted by the ideological bourgeois—the wealthy donor class and their proxy intellectuals who demand "equitable" systems that benefit the poor while actually creating dependency and control. They've weaponized the language of compassion. Meanwhile, the actual worker—the one pulling three jobs—is erased from the conversation entirely.
