### Mayor Lurie Approves Reparations

Mayor Daniel Lurie signed **Ordinance No. 258-25** on December 23, 2025, establishing the Reparations Fund. The ordinance had passed the Board of Supervisors on December 16 with unanimous support.

The fund is authorized to receive monies—whether appropriated or donated—to support and implement the recommendations in the **San Francisco Reparations Plan 2023**, submitted by the African American Reparations Advisory Committee and prepared by the Human Rights Commission. The ordinance designates the Human Rights Commission as the administrator of the fund, with authority to expend monies solely for purposes of supporting and implementing the Reparations Plan's recommendations.

The Reparations Plan outlines methods to provide restitution, compensation, and rehabilitation to individuals who are Black and/or descendants of chattel enslaved persons and who have experienced proven harm in San Francisco, including displacement from urban renewal activities conducted by the former San Francisco Redevelopment Agency between 1954 and 1973.

The ordinance becomes effective 30 days after the Mayor's signature, meaning it will take effect around January 22, 2026.
