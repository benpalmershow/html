### **68,000 MA Noncitizen SNAP Participants**

In 2023, 68,000 noncitizens collected SNAP benefits in Massachusetts.

**Noncitizen:** Individuals residing in the United States who are not natural-born or naturalized citizens. These include lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylees, those granted a stay of deportation, and undocumented individuals. Lawfully present noncitizens are subject to additional nonfinancial eligibility criteria. Undocumented individuals are not eligible to receive SNAP benefits, but may be nonparticipating members of SNAP households.

**Deemed income:** Individual sponsors of certain noncitizens may be subject to sponsor-to-noncitizen deeming, which counts the sponsor's income and resources as part of the noncitizen's income and resources when determining eligibility for SNAP.

Massachusetts ranks among the higher states for noncitizen SNAP participation, placing it in the mid-to-upper tier nationally alongside California (352,000), Florida (330,000), and Illinois (63,000).

Massachusetts maintains a 14.10 percent payment error rate in SNAP administration - among the worst nationally. Starting in fiscal year 2028, federal penalties will apply to states exceeding a 6% error threshold, potentially costing Massachusetts 10-15 percent of its SNAP benefit costs.
