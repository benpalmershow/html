### <i data-lucide='pizza' class='post-icon'></i> **The Longest Fast: Angus Barbieri's 382-Day Record**

In 1965, a Scottish man named Angus Barbieri checked into a hospital and stopped eating solid food for 382 consecutive days. Starting at 456 pounds, he survived on only vitamins, electrolytes, tea, coffee, and sparkling water before breaking his fast on July 11, 1966, with a boiled egg and buttered bread - a moment captured by newspaper photographers waiting to document the event.

Barbieri's medical team was astonished. He lost 276 pounds without hospitalization for most of the fast, maintaining his discipline from his home in Tayport while making regular checkups. By the time he broke his fast, his body had adapted so completely that he said food had lost all temptation - a psychological shift doctors found as remarkable as the physical transformation.

The Guinness Book of Records officially recognized his achievement in 1971 as the longest recorded fast without solid food. As of 2025, Barbieri still holds this record, though Guinness no longer actively promotes fasting records due to safety concerns. After his fast, he settled in Warwick with his wife Mary and two sons, and a 1973 medical study confirmed he maintained a healthy weight with no lasting ill effects.
