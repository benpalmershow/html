### <i data-lucide='book' class='post-icon'></i> **Food Intelligence**

Award-winning health journalist Julia Belluz and nutrition scientist Kevin Hall reveal how your food environment shapes eating behavior more than willpower. The book shows "how diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes are not a result of a failure of will power; they are consequences of food systems working as designed."

The book breaks down how protein, fat, carbs, and vitamins actually impact your body and explores metabolism science. Protein differs fundamentally from carbohydrates and fat - it contains nitrogen, a critical element your body uses to build muscle, enzymes, antibodies, and hormones. Metabolism is the biochemical process that converts food into energy and new tissue, determining how your body processes and stores what you eat.
