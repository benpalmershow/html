### <i data-lucide='dollar-sign' class='post-icon'></i> **Minimum Wage Laws Diverge Across States**

The federal minimum wage remains frozen at $7.25 since 2009, but 30 states and DC have enacted their own increases. The EPI Minimum Wage Tracker reveals how dramatically labor standards vary - from Alabama and Wyoming at the federal floor to California, Massachusetts, and Washington pushing toward $18+.

**Key Statistics:**
- **States Above Federal Minimum:** 30 states + DC
- **Localities with Higher Wages:** 68 cities and counties have adopted rates above their state minimums
- **Indexing:** 19 states automatically adjust for inflation
- **Federal Minimum:** $7.25/hour (last increased July 24, 2009)

68 localities - concentrated in California, New York, and Washington - have set their own minimum wages, creating a patchwork that mirrors regional cost-of-living differences.
