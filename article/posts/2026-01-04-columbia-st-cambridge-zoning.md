### <i data-lucide='gavel' class='post-icon'></i> **Inclusionary Housing**

Columbia St LLC sued Cambridge over a mandate forcing developers to surrender 20% of floor area to permanent affordable housing without payment. The ordinance exemplifies unchecked government land-use authority - seizing private property for public benefit while exempting everyone else.

**Fifth Amendment:** "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."

**Massachusetts Article X:** "no part of the property of any individual can, with justice, be taken from him... he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor."

Cambridge imposed this citywide in 2016 with zero analysis. Columbia alone finances affordable housing policy.

The **unconstitutional conditions doctrine** prevents government from forcing value transfers without showing why. Sheetz v. County of El Dorado (2024) clarified that broad regulatory takings violate this principle just as much as ad hoc exactions.

Dolan (1994) and Koontz (2013) established the framework. Cambridge satisfies none of it.

## Why It Matters

This case tests whether cities can extract permanent property transfers through regulation while applying uniform rules rather than individualized findings. If Cambridge wins, municipalities nationwide gain authority to extract substantial private assets from selected developers. If Columbia wins, cities must prove direct nexus and proportionality before imposing affordability mandates.

**The outcome reshapes land-use authority across the country.**
