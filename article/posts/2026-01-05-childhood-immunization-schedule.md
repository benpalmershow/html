### <i data-lucide='syringe' class='post-icon'></i> **Childhood Immunization Schedule Revised**

HHS released a comprehensive reassessment of the U.S. childhood immunization schedule, reducing the core routine vaccines from 17-18 diseases down to 11. The new consensus schedule focuses on vaccines where international agreement exists, moving other vaccines to "shared clinical decision-making" status for individual risk assessment.

The 72-injection figure for 2024 includes multiple recurring doses: annual influenza vaccines (up to 18 doses from age 6 months to 18 years), COVID-19 boosters, and RSV monoclonal antibodies. The new schedule moves influenza and COVID-19 to shared clinical decision-making, significantly reducing cumulative injection burden over childhood.

**Injection Reduction Breakdown:**

| Category | 2024 Injections | 2026 Core Routine |
|---|---|---|
| Core 11 Vaccines | ~40 | ~36 |
| Annual Influenza (up to 18 years) | ~18 | 0 |
| COVID-19 Boosters | ~8 | 0 |
| RSV Monoclonal Antibodies | ~2 | 0 |
| Hepatitis A | ~2 | 0 |
| Rotavirus | ~2 | 0 |
| Meningococcal B/ACWY | ~1-2 | 0 |
| **Total** | **~72** | **~36** |

*Note: The 2026 total of ~36 represents only the core routine vaccines. Non-core vaccines (influenza, COVID-19, etc.) remain available but are no longer routinely recommended, reducing the standard schedule by approximately 50% while maintaining access for individual clinical decisions.*

**Core Vaccine Dose Breakdown (2026 Schedule):**

The 11 core vaccines require multiple doses over childhood:

- **[DTaP (Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTaP_vaccine)**: 5 doses
- **[Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae_vaccine)**: 4 doses
- **[Pneumococcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_vaccine)**: 4 doses
- **[Polio (IPV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine)**: 4 doses
- **[MMR (Measles/Mumps/Rubella)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine)**: 2 doses
- **[Varicella (Chickenpox)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine)**: 2 doses
- **[HPV (Human Papillomavirus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine)**: 1 dose
- **Total: ~22 core doses**

The ~36 figure includes slight scheduling variations and potential catch-up doses.

**Schedule Comparison:**

| # | Disease/Vaccine | 2024 | 2026 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Measles | Yes | Yes |
| 2 | Mumps | Yes | Yes |
| 3 | Rubella | Yes | Yes |
| 4 | Polio | Yes | Yes |
| 5 | Pertussis | Yes | Yes |
| 6 | Tetanus | Yes | Yes |
| 7 | Diphtheria | Yes | Yes |
| 8 | Hib | Yes | Yes |
| 9 | Pneumococcal | Yes | Yes |
| 10 | HPV | Yes (2-3 doses) | Yes (1 dose) |
| 11 | Varicella | Yes | Yes |
| — | Hepatitis A | Yes | No |
| — | Hepatitis B | Yes (birth) | No |
| — | Rotavirus | Yes | No |
| — | Meningococcal B | Yes | No |
| — | Meningococcal ACWY | Yes | No |
| — | Influenza | Yes | No |
| — | COVID-19 | Yes | No |
| — | Dengue | Yes | No |
| — | RSV Monoclonal Antibodies | Yes | No |

All vaccines remain covered by insurance without cost sharing. The shift emphasizes informed consent over mandates, aligning the U.S. with peer nations' practices while maintaining vaccine availability for parents who choose them.
