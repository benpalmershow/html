### <i data-lucide='building-2' class='post-icon'></i> **NO ROOM AT THE INN!**

DHS publicly accused Hilton of a "coordinated campaign" to refuse service to ICE officers in Minneapolis. The agency's viral post reached 7.1 million views, sparking boycott pledges and competitive positioning from Marriott, Hyatt, and others.

**The Franchise Complication:**

The disputed Minneapolis property operates under independent franchise (Everpeakhotels.com), not corporate Hilton. Critics note the franchisee distinction undermines DHS's coordinated campaign claim, though the company stated it investigates all such incidents.

**Market Impact:**

HLT closed down 2.46% to $285.77.
