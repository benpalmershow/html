### <i data-lucide='globe' class='post-icon'></i> **🇻🇪 Rodríguez, González, or Machado?**

Kalshi and Polymarket are pricing the likelihood of who will lead Venezuela on December 31, 2026. Delcy Rodríguez currently leads the field at 42¢, followed by Edmundo González at 22¢ and María Corina Machado at 18¢. González won 67% of the vote in the contested July 2024 election, though official results favored Maduro.

**Current Market Odds:**
- **[Delcy Rodríguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delcy_Rodríguez)**: 42¢ (frontrunner)
- **[Edmundo González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_González_Urrutia)**: 22¢ (opposition figure)
- **[María Corina Machado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/María_Corina_Machado)**: 18¢ (opposition party)
- **[Vladimir Padrino López](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Padrino_López)**: 6¢ (military leader)
- **[Nicolás Maduro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolás_Maduro)**: 5¢ (incumbent)
- **No Head of State**: 3¢ (institutional breakdown)
- **Others**: <1¢ combined

Markets resolve based on who officially holds the position of head of state on December 31, 2026, across both platforms.
