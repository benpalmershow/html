### <i data-lucide='briefcase' class='post-icon'></i> **Manufacturing Contraction**

December ISM Manufacturing PMI slipped to 47.9, extending the contraction that has persisted throughout 2025. The index remains firmly below 50, indicating sustained weakness in manufacturing activity and new orders.

**Latest Data:**
- **December**: 47.9 (-0.6% MoM)
- **November**: 48.2
- **October**: 48.7
- **Trend**: Seven consecutive months below 50 (since June)

Manufacturing continues to signal economic caution, with soft demand and inventory management constraining production activity. Below 50 readings typically precede broader economic slowdowns, making this an important early-warning indicator.
