### <i data-lucide='scale' class='post-icon'></i> **Warm Collectivism**

PGE's new Base Services Charge decouples utility usage from service, matching energy bills to customer income levels and shifting cost burdens from low-income households. The policy rolls out March 2026.

**What It Does:**
- Separates fixed service costs from usage-based charges
- Adjusts billing based on customer income levels
- Redistributes cost burden away from lower-income customers

**Why It Matters:**
This represents a fundamental shift in utility pricing philosophy - from market-based pricing to income-adjusted subsidies. Customers with higher incomes pay proportionally more to offset lower-income customers' bills, socializing energy costs through the utility system.
