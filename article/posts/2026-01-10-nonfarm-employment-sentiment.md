### <i data-lucide="users" class="post-icon"></i> **+50k Jobs, Sentiment Recovers**

December nonfarm payrolls added 50,000 jobs as consumer sentiment bounced to 54 in January, signaling modest labor market resilience alongside improving household confidence.

**December Employment:** 159,526,000  
**November Employment:** 159,476,000  
**Monthly Change:** +50,000 (+0.03% MoM)

The modest job gain reflects a labor market that remains in equilibrium, neither accelerating nor contracting significantly. This level of hiring keeps pace with natural population growth and maintains existing employment levels without meaningful expansion.

**January Sentiment:** 54  
**December Sentiment:** 52.9  
**Monthly Change:** +1.1 points (+2.08% MoM)

Consumer sentiment improved to 54 in early January, reversing recent declines and suggesting households are regaining confidence about economic prospects. The recovery, while modest, indicates consumers are responding positively to current conditions - a shift from the pessimism that dominated late 2025.

The combination of steady employment growth and recovering sentiment creates a stable economic backdrop, though neither metric signals acceleration. Consumers are feeling better about their circumstances, but the job market remains measured rather than booming.
