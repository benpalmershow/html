### <i data-lucide='home' class='post-icon'></i> **Housing Market: Inventory and Days on Market**

Housing inventory continues to shift as homes spend increasingly longer on the market. Days on Market (Median) reached 65 days in December, up from 59 in November - a sign of cooling demand or increased supply constraints pushing the market toward equilibrium.

Existing Home Sales held steady at 4.35M in December, reflecting modest but stable activity heading into the new year. Days on market metrics suggest buyer patience is increasing as sellers adjust expectations in the current environment.

**Game Context**

The #1 seed Broncos face the #6 Bills in a rematch of playoff history. Buffalo holds a 1-0 advantage in postseason meetings, but Denver's regular season dominance and home field advantage make them slight favorites in Saturday's AFC matchup.

Seattle's dominant 2025 season earns them the top NFC seed and heavy favorites status. The 49ers head to the Pacific Northwest as substantial underdogs despite their upset victory over Philadelphia in the Wild Card round.

New England's home playoff advantage favors the Patriots despite Houston's offensive firepower. The Patriots hold the edge in market expectations heading into Sunday's AFC divisional matchup.

Matthew Stafford's league-leading arm talent and the Rams' high-octane offense command 63¢ odds against Caleb Williams' Bears at Soldier Field. Los Angeles travels to Chicago as road favorites with defensive vulnerabilities that Chicago's league-leading turnover generation may exploit.
