### <i data-lucide='alert-triangle' class='post-icon'></i> **NYC $10.4B Short**

Comptroller Mark Levine projects historic budget gaps following misbudgeting from the Adams administration. This marks the first time since the Great Recession that New York City faces shortfalls of this scale this late in the fiscal year.

**The Numbers:**

- **FY2026 Shortfall**: $2.2 billion
- **FY2027 Projected Gap**: $10.4 billion
- **Underlying cause**: Adams administration overspending and chronic underbudgeting of recurring expenses

**The Problem**

The shortfalls stem not from economic weakness - tourism, Broadway, commercial leasing, and stock market gains continue to support strong tax revenues. Instead, chronic mismanagement created structural gaps. The city budgeted below actual spending needs on rental assistance, overtime, shelter, public assistance, Department of Education due process cases, and MTA contributions, totaling $3.8 billion in unbudgeted FY2026 expenses alone.

**Where It's Coming From**

The comptroller identified systemic underbudgeting across multiple departments:

- **Rental Assistance**: $795 million gap in FY2026 alone (projected $2 billion in FY2027)
- **Shelter & Capacity**: $630 million (non-asylum seeker)
- **Overtime**: $727 million
- **Public Assistance**: $641 million
- **MTA Contributions**: $392 million
- **DOE Due Process Cases**: $558 million

This pattern repeated for years - the Adams administration consistently underfunded known, recurring expenses, relying on year-end adjustments and one-time accounting measures to appear balanced.

Mayor Mamdani faces the difficult task of crafting a balanced preliminary budget in February. Comptroller Levine pledged to work with the new administration and Albany to close the gaps.
