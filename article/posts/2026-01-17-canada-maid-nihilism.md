### <i data-lucide="heart-handshake" class="post-icon"></i> **Canada Affirms Despair**

A Canadian with mental illness is now claiming discrimination for being denied Medical Aid in Dying (MAID). What was framed as compassionate end-of-life care has become a cultural statement about the value of life itself.

**The Shift from Palliative to Preventive**

MAID began as a narrow policy for patients with terminal illnesses and unbearable physical suffering. It has steadily expanded to include psychological suffering, and now to those deemed to have "irremediable illnesses and persistent intolerable suffering" - language deliberately vague enough to encompass depression, anxiety, and general despair.

Governor Hochul of New York captured the sentiment: "If a suffering New Yorker made the difficult choice to die, who am I to stand in their way?" The question itself reveals a philosophical trap.

**The Cultural Collapse**

What this signals is not compassion. It signals the absence of a formidable cultural heritage strong enough to derail nihilism. When a society offers medical assistance in dying to the mentally ill rather than cultural remedies - meaning, purpose, community, laughter - it has lost respect for life itself.

This is not about autonomy. This is not about equality.

**An Alternative Reality**

Some have lived in abject poverty where "irremediable illnesses and persistent intolerable suffering" was never suggestive of an inalienable right to death. They endured the slings and arrows. They chose laughter and life. They recovered. They persisted. Maybe they thrived. But their whole life, they suffered. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the meaning of life. To be or not to be.
