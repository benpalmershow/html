### <i data-lucide='home' class='post-icon'></i> **Buyers Gain Historic Leverage: Record 47% More Sellers Than Buyers**

Home sellers outnumbered buyers by a record margin in December, marking a dramatic shift in market power toward home shoppers. With 631,535 more sellers than buyers, this 47.1% imbalance is the largest gap in over a decade - and it's accelerating.

- **Sellers vs. Buyers Gap:** 47.1% (+7.1 percentage points MoM, +22.2 points YoY)
- **Homebuyers in Market:** 1.34M (-5.9% MoM, lowest since 2013)
- **Sellers in Market:** 1.97M (-1.1% MoM)
- **National Home Price Growth:** 0.1% YoY (slowest since June 2023)
- **Median Days on Market:** 65 days (+9.5% MoM)

The buyer retreat accelerated dramatically. While sellers also pulled back, they did so at half the pace of buyers, creating unprecedented imbalance. High home prices, stubbornly elevated mortgage rates (6.19% for 30-year), and economic uncertainty drove many buyers out of the market entirely. Dallas experienced the sharpest price decline - down 7.6% YoY with 86.8% more sellers than buyers. Meanwhile, the Sun Belt dominated buyer's markets, while the entire Northeast and Midwest contained all five seller's markets.
