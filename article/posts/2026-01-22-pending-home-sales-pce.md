### <i data-lucide='home' class='post-icon'></i> **Pending Home Sales Slide While Consumers Keep Spending**

Divergent signals from the housing and consumer sectors. December's sharp decline in Pending Home Sales contrasts with November's resilient consumer spending—a timing gap that obscures whether momentum has shifted since the start of the year.

### <i data-lucide='home' class='post-icon'></i> **Pending Home Sales Index Down**

December pending home sales dropped to 71.8, a 9.3% decline from November's 79.2. The index remains well below long-term averages, signaling continued weakness in the housing market despite lower mortgage rates.

The decline underscores softening housing demand as homebuyers navigate affordability constraints and seasonal slowdowns heading into year-end. As a leading indicator, this weakness typically precedes slower existing home sales in the coming weeks.

### <i data-lucide='shopping-cart' class='post-icon'></i> **Consumer Spending Remains Steady**

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose to $21,409.7B in November, up 0.5% from October's $21,301.0B. While this data trails December's pending home sales report, consumer spending continues to support economic growth despite headwinds in housing and tightening labor markets.

The modest increase reflects consumers' persistent purchasing, though growth rates remain below pre-pandemic trends. This resilience suggests consumers are still engaging the economy even as housing activity cools, bolstering the case for a soft landing scenario.
