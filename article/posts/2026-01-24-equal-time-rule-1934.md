### <i data-lucide='radio' class='post-icon'></i> **"Equal Time" Rule: An Artifact of the 1934 Communications Act**

The equal time rule requires broadcast stations to offer equal opportunities to legally qualified political candidates. Enacted in 1934 as Section 315 of the Communications Act, this provision became a cornerstone of broadcast regulation that shaped electoral communication for nearly a century.

**The Framework:**

The rule mandates that if a broadcast station allows one legally qualified candidate for the same office to use its facilities, it must provide equal opportunities to other candidates. "Equal" refers to time, charges, and conditions of access. The rule applies exclusively to broadcast television and radio, not cable, satellite, or streaming platforms.

**The Legal Mechanics:**

- Broadcasters cannot censor candidate speech but gain a safe harbor if all candidates receive equal access
- Stations may charge rates no higher than the lowest commercial rate for similar time
- "Use" by one candidate triggers obligations for others, even if the first candidate appeared as a guest on a news program
- Certain news formats (bona fide news interviews, on-the-spot news coverage, debates) carry exemptions

**Why It Endures Despite Fragmentation:**

The rule persists as a relic of the scarcity rationale: broadcast spectrum was finite, requiring licensees to serve the public interest. Cable, satellite, and digital platforms shattered that scarcity, yet Section 315 remains unamended. Broadcasters operate under dual regulations - the equal time mandate alongside editorial discretion traditionally afforded newspapers.

**Contemporary Friction:**

Election cycles test the rule's boundaries. When a candidate announces candidacy during a news appearance, does that trigger equal time obligations for others? When a sitting president governs on camera, do appearances constitute campaign "uses"? The FCC has issued countless rulings clarifying distinctions between news coverage and campaign activity.
