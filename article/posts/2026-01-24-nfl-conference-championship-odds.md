**AFC Championship: Patriots @ Broncos**

The New England Patriots travel to Denver as significant road favorites. Despite being the #2 seed, the Patriots (69¢) command the market edge as Broncos starting QB Bo Nix has been ruled out with an injury sustained in their overtime divisional win against Buffalo. Denver's defense, which led the league in sacks this season, will need a monumental performance to contain the New England offense.

**NFC Championship: Rams @ Seahawks**

In the NFC, the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks (58¢) host the Los Angeles Rams in a clash between division rivals. Seattle's "12th Man" home-field advantage at Lumen Field is reflected in their favorite status, though the Rams (42¢) enter the game with momentum following their overtime victory in Chicago. This matchup pits Seattle's top-ranked pass defense against Matthew Stafford's high-volume air attack.
