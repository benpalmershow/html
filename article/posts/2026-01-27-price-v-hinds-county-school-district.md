### <i data-lucide='book' class='post-icon'></i> **I Need a New Butt!**

Mississippi's Court of Appeals ruled that an elementary school administrator was wrongfully terminated for reading an age-appropriate children's book to second graders, establishing that school districts must prove book content violates professional standards rather than dismissing educators on subjective grounds.

**The Legal Framework:**

The case involves competing interests: school district authority over curriculum versus educator free speech and due process rights. The court applied the standard from public employee speech cases, requiring school districts to demonstrate that an educator's conduct actually violated established professional standards or district policy. The district cannot rely on administrative disapproval alone. Mississippi law also protects employees from termination that is "arbitrary and capricious."

**The Facts:**

On March 1, 2022, Toby Price, Assistant Principal at Gary Road Elementary School in the Hinds County School District, read "I Need a New Butt!" by Dawn McMillan to a second-grade class during Read Across America Day when the scheduled reader failed to appear. The book, published in 2014, contains humorous references to bodily functions appropriate for its intended audience. District Superintendent Delescia Martin placed Price on administrative leave the same day and terminated his employment two days later, citing unprofessional conduct. Price appealed to the School Board, which upheld the termination.

**Why It Matters:**

The ruling reverses a troubling trend in K-12 education where administrators dismiss educators without substantive evidence. The court found the district failed to prove the book was inappropriate and noted that the school library contained many books with similar content that had previously been read to students without incident. The decision protects educators from arbitrary termination based on subjective administrative preferences rather than established standards or policies. It reinforces that fostering a love of reading should not expose teachers to employment termination.
