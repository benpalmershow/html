### <i data-lucide='trending-up' class='post-icon'></i> **Life Expectancy and Factory Activity Up**

U.S. life expectancy reached 79 years in 2024, the highest ever recorded, driven by the largest decline in drug overdose death rates on record. Overall mortality decreased 4% year-over-year, with overdose deaths falling 26.2% as synthetic opioid deaths dropped 35.6%.

**Key Figures:**

- **Life Expectancy**: 79 years (up from 78.4 in 2023)
- **Overall Death Rate**: 722.1 per 100,000 (down from 750.5)
- **Drug Overdose Deaths**: 79,384 total; rate fell from 31.3 to 23.1 per 100,000 (-26.2%)
- **Synthetic Opioids**: Down 35.6% (from 22.2 to 14.3 per 100,000)
- **Cocaine Deaths**: Down 26.7% (from 8.6 to 6.3 per 100,000)
- **Methamphetamine Deaths**: Down 19.8% (from 10.6 to 8.5 per 100,000)

The improvement extends across demographic groups, with the largest gains among younger people and Black non-Hispanic populations. Other significant shifts include COVID-19 dropping out of the top 10 causes of death, while suicide entered as the 10th leading cause. Heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries remain the top three causes.
