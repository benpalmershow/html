### <i data-lucide='shield-alert' class='post-icon'></i> **"Despite claims, massive SNAP fraud is rare"**

They say no fraud but Massachusetts auditor Diana DiZoglio's Bureau of Special Investigations identified $11.95 million in public benefit fraud during fiscal year 2025, with 4,179 completed investigations uncovering systemic vulnerabilities in SNAP, MassHealth, and welfare programs.

**FY2025 Results:** $11.95M in fraud identified across 4,179 investigations. SNAP fraud totaled $4.1 million, while MassHealth fraud reached $1.3 million. Civil recoveries recovered nearly $800,000 in fraudulent overpayments.

The bureau's work helped secure a guilty plea from a Hyannis woman for over $140,000 in welfare fraud and an admission of fraud from a Gloucester woman totaling $20,000. These cases illustrate the scale of individual benefit abuse and the state's commitment to protecting resources for eligible recipients.
