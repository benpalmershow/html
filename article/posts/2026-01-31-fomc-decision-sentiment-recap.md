### <i data-lucide='trending-up' class='post-icon'></i> **FOMC Holds as Predicted, Consumer Sentiment Rebounds**

The Federal Reserve made its January rate decision official this week, holding the federal funds rate steady as expected. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment improved significantly, suggesting households are gaining confidence despite persistent economic uncertainty.

**The FOMC Decision:**

As markets predicted, the FOMC voted to keep rates unchanged at the January 27-28 meeting. The 95¢ probability in prediction markets proved accurate - a hold was the overwhelming consensus. The decision reflects confidence that inflation remains manageable and the labor market, while cooling, remains resilient enough to avoid aggressive cutting cycles.

**Dollar Weakens in January:**

The U.S. dollar lost ground in January, with the Dollar Value Index declining to 119.28 from December's 120.57 (-1.1% MoM). The softer dollar reflects softer rate hold expectations and suggests traders are pricing in potential cuts later in 2026, despite this month's hold decision.

**Consumer Sentiment vs. Confidence - Mixed Signals:**

Consumer sentiment improved notably in January, rising to 56.4 from December's 52.9 - a 3.5-point gain suggesting better household optimism. However, The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index painted a more pessimistic picture, plummeting to 84.5 from December's 94.2 (-10.3% MoM). The divergence suggests near-term sentiment is brightening while longer-term expectations are souring.
