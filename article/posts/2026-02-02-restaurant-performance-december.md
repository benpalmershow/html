### <i data-lucide='shopping-cart' class='post-icon'></i> **Restaurant Performance Index Slides to 99.3 in December**

The National Restaurant Association's monthly performance gauge fell 0.8% to 99.3 in December, marking the lowest reading since March and signaling softening demand across the restaurant industry. Both current conditions and future outlook weakened, as operators reported the first net decline in same-store sales in nine months.

- **Restaurant Performance Index:** 99.3 (-0.8% MoM, contraction territory below 100)
- **Current Situation Index:** 98.3 (-1.0% MoM, sixth consecutive month below 100)
- **Same-Store Sales:** 98.3 (-2.0% MoM, first net decline since March)
- **Customer Traffic:** 96.8 (-1.2% MoM, eleventh consecutive month of declines)
- **Expectations Index:** 100.2 (-0.6% MoM, mixed six-month outlook)

Sales weakness accelerated dramatically. Only 37% of operators reported rising sales year-over-year, down from 47% in November, while 53% reported declines. Traffic deteriorated further with 60% of operators seeing lower traffic and just 28% reporting gains. Despite the pessimism, capital spending remains elevated - 51% of operators made recent equipment investments and 53% plan spending over the next six months. Operators remain uncertain about the broader economy, with only 25% expecting improvement in the next six months.
