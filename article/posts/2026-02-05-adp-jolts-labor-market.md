### <i data-lucide='briefcase' class='post-icon'></i> **Labor Market Stalled Since September Collapse**

January added 22,000 jobs, consistent with a labor market that has essentially flatlined for five months.

**Job Openings (December JOLTS):** 6.542M (-5.9% MoM)

Job openings fell to 6.542M from 6.928M in November - a loss of 386,000 positions in one month. Openings have been declining consistently from peaks near 7.5M in 2022. The labor market tightness that defined the post-pandemic era has broken, yet employment growth has stalled rather than accelerated to fill the gap.

The disconnect is stark: employers are cutting job openings while employees aren't being hired to replace departing workers. This is neither rebalancing nor resilience - it's contraction.
