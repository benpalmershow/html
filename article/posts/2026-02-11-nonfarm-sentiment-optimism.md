### <i data-lucide='users' class='post-icon'></i> **Jobs, Small Biz, Optimism, Oil, Scroll**

January saw payroll growth of 130,000 jobs, slightly above the 127,000 added in December. The labor market continues adding jobs at a steady pace despite broader economic uncertainty, driven by strength in leisure and hospitality services.

**December:** 158,497,000  
**January:** 158,627,000  
**Monthly Change:** +130,000 (+0.1% MoM)

The consistent monthly additions keep the economy near full employment, though employment growth has slowed from the faster pace seen earlier in 2025. Job cuts announcements remain elevated, suggesting ongoing corporate restructuring even as hiring continues.

### <i data-lucide='briefcase' class='post-icon'></i> **Small Business Optimism Slides to 99.3**

The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index declined to 99.3 in January from 99.5 in December, signaling cautious business sentiment. Small business owners remain below the 100-point expansion threshold, reflecting concern about economic conditions and policy uncertainty.

**December:** 99.5  
**January:** 99.3  
**Change:** -0.2 points

Small businesses account for nearly half of U.S. economic activity and are often the first to react to changing conditions. The slight decline suggests business owners are holding back on capital spending and hiring plans despite steady job creation in the broader economy.

### <i data-lucide='chart-line' class='post-icon'></i> **American Optimism Hits Record Low**

A new Gallup poll reveals that American optimism about future life quality has collapsed to 59.2% in 2025 - the lowest level since measurement began nearly two decades ago. The deterioration has been sharp: optimism declined 9.1 percentage points since 2020, with 3.5 points of that drop occurring between 2024 and 2025 alone.

The data breaks down starkly by political affiliation. Democrats plummeted 7.6 points in 2025, while Republicans remained essentially flat. Hispanic adults and those identifying as Democrats showed the greatest year-over-year declines, with Hispanic optimism falling more sharply in the past year than Black adults despite historically lower Black optimism levels.

The gap between current life satisfaction and future life expectations reveals deep anxiety: while Americans' views of their present lives haven't recovered to 2020 lows, their expectations for the next five years have deteriorated significantly. At current trends, Gallup estimates roughly 24.5 million fewer people consider themselves optimistic about their future compared to 2020.

### <i data-lucide='fuel' class='post-icon'></i> **Venezuela Oil: Trump Opens Door for Investment**

The Trump administration issued new general licenses authorizing U.S. oil companies to rehabilitate and repair existing assets in Venezuela, following the capture of Nicolás Maduro in January and a <b>$2 billion oil supply deal</b>. Energy Secretary Chris Wright met with Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez this week as the U.S. pursues a <b>$100 billion reconstruction plan</b> for Venezuela's energy infrastructure.

The licenses cover maintenance of oil and gas operations, refurbishment of exploration and production equipment, and shipping logistics. Companies are still awaiting final licenses to actually drill for new crude, but this marks Trump's doctrine of "American energy dominance" reshaping global oil markets - leveraging Venezuelan, Guyana, Saudi Arabian, and UAE production to reduce dependence on Russian oil and reshape geopolitical leverage.

**Investment thesis:** Oilfield service companies like <a href='https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HAL' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>HAL</a> (Halliburton) and <a href='https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLB' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>SLB</a> (Schlumberger) are positioned to capitalize on rehabilitation contracts. Existing operators like Chevron and Spain's Repsol can optimize existing investments. Venezuela holds the world's largest crude reserves; unlocked production shifts global energy dynamics.

### <i data-lucide='smartphone' class='post-icon'></i> **Infinite Scroll is Nicotine**

Companies engineer addictive engagement because profit motive demands engagement. The problem isn't disclaimers - it's that consumers want what is bad for them. We sue tobacco makers but sue for what? The remedy isn't regulation or warnings. Stop buying and they stop selling. Externality mitigation requires personal agency, not litigation.

How to advise without being sycophantic? How to engage without addiction? Until those questions shift corporate incentives, expect more addictive design, more lawsuits, and the same cycle repeating.
