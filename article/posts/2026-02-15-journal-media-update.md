### <i data-lucide='trending-up' class='post-icon'></i> **Debt %, CPI, Housing Market, and Wagner**

## Dept Interest
The CBO's latest budget outlook projects a $1.9 trillion deficit this year. But interest costs tell the real story. Interest outlays hit $1.0 trillion in 2026 and will double to $2.1 trillion by 2036. For every dollar borrowed, 66 cents services debt. Interest will exceed defense spending every year and triple it by decade's end.

This mirrors California and New York City, where long-term structural spending obligations outpaced revenue growth until refinancing became unmanageable. You cannot negotiate with compound mathematics. When deficits drive debt to 120 percent of GDP, interest becomes the fastest-growing budget item, crowding out everything else.

California's pension obligations and NYC's 1970s crisis followed the same logic: overspending built on diffuse political accountability becomes an anchor on the budget. Tax increases, service cuts, or defaults are the only paths forward.

### **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The Consumer Price Index stands at 325.252 in January 2026, up 2.4% year-over-year. Core inflation remains sticky at the 3% range, though headline CPI moderated from the September peak of 3.0%. December posted 2.7% YoY growth, holding steady as the Fed navigates the dual mandate of price stability and full employment.

### **Housing Market**

Median home prices declined to $396,800 in January 2026, down 2.1% from December's $405,400 and falling from the June peak of $432,700. The decline reflects cooling demand as higher mortgage rates persist—the 30-year fixed rate hovered near 6.2% through the period.

Existing home sales fell to 3.91M (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in January, marking an 8.4% decrease from December. The downward trend accelerated across Q4 and early 2026, signaling reduced affordability and tightening conditions for homebuyers.
