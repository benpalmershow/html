* No accreditation requirements (anyone can invest)

* 1% management fee for first six months (reduced from 2%)
* No performance fees
* Daily liquidity through NYSE trading
* If extra cash, dividends to shareholders. 

## Important: Closed-End Fund Structure

RVI is a **closed-end fund**, which means shareholders cannot redeem shares on demand (unlike open-end mutual funds). While shares trade daily on the NYSE, shareholders depend on secondary market sales to liquidate positions. There is no guarantee an active market will exist or that shares can be sold at desired prices. Investors should carefully consider this structure before committing capital.

This is a speculative investment with substantial risk of loss. Private companies may never have a liquidity event or go public.
