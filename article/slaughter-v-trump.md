# Trump v. Slaughter: Presidential Power Over Independent Agencies

**Case:** Trump, President of the United States v. Slaughter  
**Case Number:** 25-332  
**Oral Argument Date:** December 8, 2025  
**Duration:** 2 hours, 30 minutes, 30 seconds

---

## The Question

Whether the President has the power to remove Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioners protected by a "for cause" removal statute limiting removal to "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."

---

## Background

Trump nominated Jatinder Slaughter to the FTC during his first term; Biden renominated her in 2023 for a second seven-year term (expiring 2029). In March 2025, Trump fired her via email, citing only that her continued service would be "inconsistent with [the] Administration's priorities." A federal judge ordered her reinstatement; the D.C. Circuit declined to stay that order.

**Stakes:** The ruling will determine whether the President can control independent agencies and potentially expose removal restrictions at NLRB, NRC, Federal Reserve, SEC, CFTC, and other agencies to constitutional challenge.

---

## The Arguments

**Trump Administration (Solicitor General D. John Sauer):** The "for cause" restriction violates Article II executive power. The President must have unfettered removal authority over executive officials. *Humphrey's Executor* has been "eroded" and should be reconsidered. (Tr. p. 48, ll. 5-8)

**Slaughter (Counsel Amit Agarwal):** Congress has constitutional authority to structure independent agencies with removal protections. The President's duty to execute the law does not permit violation of it "with impunity." Overruling *Humphrey's Executor* would destabilize "dozens of institutions...that embody a distillation of human wisdom and experience." (Tr. p. 116, ll. 8-15)

---

## Justice Positions

**Likely for Trump:**
- **Chief Justice Roberts:** Called *Humphrey's Executor* a "dried husk" (Tr. p. 141, l. 15)
- **Justice Gorsuch:** Deemed it "poorly reasoned"; suggested reinvigorating the non-delegation doctrine, asking "Is the water warm, General?" (Tr. p. 45, ll. 7-8)
- **Justice Kavanaugh:** Proposed a narrow holding affecting the FTC but preserving Federal Reserve protections (Tr. p. 23, ll. 1-15)
- **Justice Barrett:** Questioned whether independent agencies became "something that Congress didn't intend"

**Likely for Slaughter:**
- **Justice Kagan:** Resisted carve-outs, arguing constitutional logic "drives you there" regardless of footnotes (Tr. p. 27, ll. 14-24)
- **Justice Sotomayor:** Pressed Sauer to name other 90-year-old precedents overruled while "fundamentally alter[ing] the structure of government"
- **Justice Jackson:** Proposed letting Congress decide the issue, questioning the government's democratic accountability argument. "I'm trying to understand why you think that Congress is somehow less democratically accountable for the way in which it constructs these agencies and determines the term of office of the officers" (Tr. p. 29, ll. 7-11)

**Assessment:** A clear majority appeared ready to rule Trump has removal power. Less certain: whether the Court would formally overrule *Humphrey's Executor* or craft a narrow holding.

---

## Critical Hypotheticals

**Multi-Member Structure (Justice Alito):** Would structural protections matter if terms were short and no partisan balance requirement existed? Agarwal responded that single-headed agencies with removal restrictions pose greater threats to individual liberty.

**Carve-Outs (Justice Kavanaugh/Kagan):** Kavanaugh proposed excluding Federal Reserve governors as "unique" and "distinct." Kagan countered that footnotes carving exceptions "doesn't do much good if the entire logic of the opinion drives you" there. (Tr. p. 23, ll. 14-15; p. 27, ll. 20-24)

**Cascade Effect (Justice Jackson):** Jackson noted the administration could challenge removal provisions at the NLRB, NRC, Commission on Civil Rights, Sentencing Commission, OSHA Review Commission, and Consumer Product Safety Commission. (Tr. p. 71, ll. 9-24)

---

## Central Tensions

**Article II vs. Article I Authority:** Trump administration: Article II vests unfettered removal power in the President. Slaughter: Article I gives Congress authority to structure agencies, including removal protections. Which branch is more "democratically accountable" for agency design?

**Institutional Stability vs. Constitutional Principle:** Agarwal warned that a Trump victory would destabilize "dozens of institutions" built over 90 years. Yet allowing potentially unconstitutional restrictions to stand contradicts bedrock principles.

**Narrow Holding Viability:** Can the Court restrict its holding to the FTC while preserving Federal Reserve protections? Kagan suggested constitutional logic doesn't work by footnote.

---

## Likely Outcome

A majority appears ready to rule the President has power to remove FTC commissioners without cause. **Most likely:** a narrow holding distinguishing the FTC from other agencies (particularly the Fed), though Kagan's warnings about constitutional logic may make such distinctions fragile. **Formal overruling of *Humphrey's Executor*:** less certain. **Immediate effect:** Slaughter's reinstatement would likely be vacated.
