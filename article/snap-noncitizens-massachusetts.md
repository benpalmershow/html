### New Soda Restrictions Effective January 1, 2026

Starting tomorrow, January 1, 2026, new SNAP retailer compliance policies will implement stricter restrictions on soda purchases.[^10] The updated USDA Food and Nutrition Service guidelines prohibit the purchase of:

- Carbonated soft drinks with added sugars
- Energy drinks with added sweeteners
- Sweetened bottled teas and fruit drinks

Retailers must update point-of-sale systems to block these transactions, and states face increased compliance monitoring under the retailer compliance policies established in the latest guidance.[^10]

## Noncitizen SNAP Participation

In FY 2023, **68,000 eligible noncitizens** participated in SNAP in Massachusetts—6.27% of the state's total SNAP population.[^1][^2] Nationally, eligible noncitizens (refugees, asylees, and other lawfully present noncitizens) represent 4.4% of all SNAP participants, while an additional 6.2% are naturalized citizens.[^3]

### Citizenship Status

**Noncitizen** : Individuals residing in the United States who are not natural-born or naturalized citizens. These include lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylees, those granted a stay of deportation, and undocumented individuals. Lawfully present noncitizens are subject to additional nonfinancial eligibility criteria. Undocumented individuals are not eligible to receive SNAP benefits, but may be nonparticipating members of SNAP households.[^4]

| Category | Percentage | Number |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Refugees & Asylees | 1.1% | 434k |
| Other Eligible Noncitizens | 3.3% | 1.33M |
| **Total Eligible Noncitizens** | **4.4%** | **1.76M** |

*Note: Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for SNAP. Citizen children of noncitizens comprise an additional 6.2% of participants. Naturalized citizens (6.2%, 2.47M) are separate—they are U.S. citizens.*[^5]

### Age Distribution

| Demographic | Noncitizen Participants | All SNAP Participants |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Elderly (60+) | 38.2% | 19.5% |
| Children (under 18) | 17.2% | 38.9% |

Noncitizen participants skew significantly older than the general SNAP population.[^6]

### State Rankings: Noncitizen SNAP Participation

| State | Participants |
|-------|-------------|
| California | 352,000 |
| Florida | 330,000 |
| **Massachusetts** | **68,000** |
| Illinois | 63,000 |

Massachusetts ranks in the mid-to-upper tier, suggesting either higher immigration with eligible status or more accessible enrollment procedures.[^6]

### Payment Error Rates

| State | Error Rate | Overpayments | Underpayments |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| New Mexico | 14.61% | — | — |
| New Jersey | 14.33% | — | — |
| **Massachusetts** | **14.10%** | **13.03%** | **1.07%** |
| New York | 14.09% | — | — |

Massachusetts's 14% error rate ranks among the worst nationally.[^8] Starting FY 2028, the One Big Beautiful Bill will penalize states exceeding 6% error rates, potentially costing Massachusetts 10-15% of its SNAP benefits.[^7]

### One Big Beautiful Bill

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) has eliminated standalone eligibility for refugees and asylees. Only lawful permanent residents (LPR), Cuban and Haitian entrants (CHE), and Compact of Free Association (COFA) citizens qualify.[^9] Refugees and asylees retain eligibility only if they have adjusted to LPR status. This change could affect hundreds of thousands of current beneficiaries nationwide.
