## Noncitizen SNAP Participation: Massachusetts Overview

In FY 2023, **68,000 noncitizens** participated in SNAP in Massachusetts—6.27% of the state's total SNAP population. Nationally, noncitizens represent 10.6% of all SNAP participants.

### Citizenship Status (National)

| Category | Percentage | Number |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Naturalized Citizens | 6.2% | 2.47M |
| Refugees & Asylees | 1.1% | 434k |
| Other Eligible Noncitizens | 3.3% | 1.33M |
| **Total Noncitizens** | **10.6%** | **4.23M** |

*Note: Undocumented immigrants are ineligible. Citizen children of noncitizens comprise an additional 6.2% of participants.*

### Age Distribution

| Demographic | Noncitizen Participants | All SNAP Participants |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Elderly (60+) | 38.2% | 19.5% |
| Children (under 18) | 17.2% | 38.9% |

Noncitizen participants skew significantly older than the general SNAP population.

### State Rankings: Noncitizen SNAP Participation

| State | Participants |
|-------|-------------|
| California | 352,000 |
| Florida | 330,000 |
| **Massachusetts** | **68,000** |
| Illinois | 63,000 |

Massachusetts ranks in the mid-to-upper tier, suggesting either higher immigration with eligible status or more accessible enrollment procedures.

### Payment Error Rates (FY 2024)

| State | Error Rate | Overpayments | Underpayments |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| New Mexico | 14.61% | — | — |
| New Jersey | 14.33% | — | — |
| **Massachusetts** | **14.10%** | **13.03%** | **1.07%** |
| New York | 14.09% | — | — |

Massachusetts's 14% error rate ranks among the worst nationally. Starting FY 2028, the One Big Beautiful Bill will penalize states exceeding 6% error rates, potentially costing Massachusetts 10-15% of its SNAP benefits.

### Policy Context

Federal law restricts SNAP eligibility to naturalized citizens, refugees, asylees, and five-year+ lawful permanent residents. States retain latitude in outreach and enrollment procedures. Massachusetts's high noncitizen caseload combined with elevated payment errors raises questions about balancing accessibility versus administrative accuracy.
