### **68k MA Noncitizen SNAP Participants**

In fiscal year 2023, 68,000 noncitizens collected SNAP benefits in Massachusetts.<sup><small>[^1]</small></sup> This represents 6.27 percent of Massachusetts's total SNAP participation.<sup><small>[^2]</small></sup>

Nationally, noncitizens represent a similar share of the SNAP population: 10.6 percent of all participants.<sup><small>[^3]</small></sup>

**Citizenship Composition Nationally**

Noncitizens comprised 10.6 percent of all national SNAP participants. Of these noncitizen participants:<sup><small>[^4]</small></sup>

- **6.2 percent** were naturalized citizens (2.47 million nationally)
- **1.1 percent** were refugees and asylees (434,000 nationally)
- **3.3 percent** were other eligible noncitizens (1.33 million nationally)

Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for SNAP benefits but may be nonparticipating members of SNAP households. An additional 6.2 percent of participants were citizen children living with noncitizen adults, demonstrating how immigration status intersects with family composition in benefit distribution.

**Age and Eligibility**

Noncitizen SNAP participants skew older than the general population. 38.2 percent of noncitizen SNAP participants nationally are elderly (age 60 or older), compared to 19.5 percent of all SNAP participants.<sup><small>[^5]</small></sup> Only 17.2 percent of noncitizen participants are children, versus 38.9 percent across the full SNAP population.

**State Variation and Massachusetts Context**

Massachusetts ranks among the higher states for noncitizen SNAP participation. California leads with 352,000 noncitizen SNAP participants, followed by Florida with 330,000 and Illinois with 63,000.<sup><small>[^6]</small></sup> Massachusetts's 68,000 noncitizen SNAP participants places it in the mid-to-upper tier nationally, suggesting the state either attracts proportionally more immigrants with eligible status or maintains more accessible enrollment procedures.

**Payment Error Rate and State Administration**

Massachusetts faces significant administrative challenges in SNAP program management. According to the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, [*Fiscal Year 2024 SNAP Quality Control Payment Error Rates*](https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-fy24QC-PER.pdf), Massachusetts maintained a 14.10 percent payment error rate (PER) - comprised of 13.03 percent overpayments and 1.07 percent underpayments. While not the highest nationally, this rate places Massachusetts among the worst performers. New Mexico leads at 14.61%, followed by New Jersey at 14.33% and New York at 14.09%. The elevated error rate reflects systemic problems in wage verification, income documentation, and recertification procedures. Starting in fiscal year 2028, the One Big Beautiful Bill legislation will impose financial penalties on states with error rates exceeding 6%, with Massachusetts potentially responsible for 10-15 percent of its SNAP benefit costs.

In FY 2023, Massachusetts established recipient claims against households for overpayments and fraud. Newly Established SNAP Recipient Claim Dollars represent the dollar amount of claims states establish against households that received more benefits than entitled - covering three categories: fraud claims (intentional violations), household error claims (inadvertent recipient mistakes), and agency error claims (state agency mistakes). These claims are collected through benefit recoupment (reducing future benefits), Treasury offset programs, or other recovery methods.

**Policy Considerations**

Recent shifts in immigration enforcement and state-level immigrant integration policies have renewed scrutiny of noncitizen benefit participation. While federal law restricts eligibility to specific categories - naturalized citizens, refugees, asylees, and lawful permanent residents who have resided in the U.S. for five years or more - state welfare agencies have latitude in outreach and simplified enrollment procedures. Massachusetts's relatively high noncitizen SNAP caseload combined with its 14 percent payment error rate raises questions about whether the state prioritizes program accessibility over administrative accuracy.
