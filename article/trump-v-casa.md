# Supreme Court Case: Trump v. CASA, Inc.

---

## Case Summary

**Issue:** Judicial authority to issue nationwide (universal) injunctions against federal policies.

**Key Question:** Can federal courts block federal policies for all, or only for the parties before them?

**Context:** Emerged from litigation over Trump administration immigration policies; over 55 nationwide injunctions issued during this period.

## Key Legal Issues

**Universal Injunctions:** Allow a single court to enjoin the government nationwide, not just for plaintiffs.

**Arguments For:** Ensure uniform law, prevent widespread constitutional violations, provide complete relief.

**Arguments Against:** Exceed judicial authority, encourage forum shopping, prevent legal issue percolation.

**Article III Limits:** "Case or controversy" requirement restricts courts to resolving disputes between specific parties.

**Standing & Remedial Principles:** Relief should be no broader than necessary for plaintiffs; universal injunctions may go beyond this.

**Separation of Powers:** Universal injunctions risk courts acting like legislators.

## Executive Summary: Key Insights

Universal injunctions raise fundamental questions about judicial power limits under Article III, balancing effective remedies and separation of powers.

Class actions (Rule 23) offer due process safeguards; universal injunctions provide expedient but less protected remedies.

Historical equity practices provide competing narratives about legitimacy of broad injunctions.

Practical concerns about uniform federal policy implementation must be balanced against constitutional limits.

The Supreme Court is increasingly skeptical, suggesting future restrictions on universal injunctions.
