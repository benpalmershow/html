# The $2000 Tariff Rebate

Solicitor General **Sauer** advanced a sharp reframing of what tariffs represent under IEEPA. He argued that when imposed under emergency authority, tariffs are **regulatory**, not **revenue-raising**, and therefore fall within the President's delegated powers to "regulate importation."

---

## 1. Tariffs as Behavioral Tools

Sauer insisted that IEEPA tariffs are most effective precisely when **no one pays them**. Their purpose is not to collect money, but to **change foreign behavior** by creating leverage in trade or security negotiations.

> **Sauer:** "The goal is deterrence. It's more effective if no one pays. These are bargaining chips, not tax instruments."

He cited the administration's record of using tariffs to pressure trading partners into specific policy actions—most notably, to push **China to curb the export of fentanyl precursors**—as evidence that such measures function as **regulatory sanctions**, not fiscal exactions.

## 2. Regulatory vs. Taxing Function

The distinction between **regulation** and **taxation** lies at the heart of the case.  
- A **tax** aims to raise revenue for the U.S. Treasury.  
- A **regulation**, even if monetary, seeks to alter conduct.

Sauer drew parallels to **Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act** and **the Algonquin decision (1976)**, where the Court upheld monetary import restrictions imposed to "adjust imports" in the national interest. He argued that IEEPA's phrase "regulate importation" is broader still and can naturally encompass economic penalties meant to induce behavioral change abroad.

---

## 3. Breadth of Delegation

Sauer characterized IEEPA as a **broad delegation** - an instrument Congress designed to give the President flexibility in emergencies.  
He emphasized that the Act authorizes the President to:

> "Investigate, block, prohibit, or otherwise regulate importation."

Under that phrasing, Sauer said, the President may impose **monetary exactions** as part of a larger regulatory program—so long as the objective is to manage national security or foreign policy risks, not to generate revenue.

## 4. The Article I–Article II Boundary

Critics argued that taxation originates in **Article I**, and therefore tariff authority must be **explicitly delegated**.  
Sauer's response reframed the issue: while tariffs look like taxes, **their purpose places them in a different constitutional category**.

> "These are not taxes from the people," he said, "but instruments of foreign policy carried out under authority Congress already conferred."

In his view:
- **Article I, Section 8** empowers Congress to regulate foreign commerce and delegate portions of that authority.
- **Article II** grants the President independent foreign affairs power to implement those regulations.
- When Congress delegates "regulate importation," it is delegating the **foreign commerce** function, not the **taxing** one.

Thus, he argued, **IEEPA sits within the zone of concurrent Article I and Article II authority**, where broader discretion is permissible.

## 5. The "Regulatory Tariff" Concept

Sauer coined the phrase **"regulatory tariff"** to describe this hybrid mechanism - a monetary measure not designed to raise revenue but to shape international conduct.  
He analogized it to **sanctions, export controls, or asset freezes**, which can have fiscal impact but are understood as regulatory.

> "A successful tariff collects nothing," he said. "Its success is measured in changed behavior, not receipts."

This framing recasts the IEEPA tariffs as part of a **foreign policy toolkit**, akin to sanctions under the Magnitsky Act or embargoes under TWEA, rather than as taxation under the Internal Revenue Code.

---

## 6. The Foreign Policy Context

Sauer closed by emphasizing **executive flexibility in crises**. The President, he said, must have room to use economic tools short of war—particularly in a global economy where coercion often takes financial, not military, form.

He linked IEEPA tariffs to broader national security goals:
- Countering **China's synthetic opioid trade**  
- Responding to **economic coercion** by rival states  
- Leveraging **reciprocity in bilateral trade**

In this framing, IEEPA tariffs serve as **strategic levers**, not fiscal policy instruments.

---

## 7. The Core Claim

Sauer's fundamental point:  
- **IEEPA tariffs are regulatory tools of foreign policy.**  
- **They derive from Congress's delegation to regulate commerce**, not its power to tax.  
- **Their success is measured by avoidance, not collection.**  
- **They lie within the President's constitutional sphere of discretion**, especially when tied to national security emergencies.

## Doctrinal Implications

| Doctrine | Sauer's View | Tension |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Nondelegation** | "Emergencies" = intelligible principle | Boundless scope? |
| **Major Questions** | Not triggered; historical precedent | Economic scale issue? |
| **Article I Tax** | Tariffs ≠ taxes when regulatory | Any exaction = tax? |
| **Article II** | Broad delegation in foreign affairs | Executive overreach? |
