summary: SCOTUS oral arguments reveal deep skepticism. Can the President impose $195 billion in tariffs under a 1977 emergency act? Justice Kavanaugh grapples with the "donut hole" problem - can the President ban all trade but not tax 1%? A major clash between executive power and Article I taxation.

# Update to Tariff SCOTUS Case

### 1. Wartime Power Delegation and Historical Use
General Sauer traced the **"regulate importation"** phrase back to the **Trading with the Enemy Act (1917)**, arguing it historically covered tariff-like powers used to restrict enemy trade. Justice Jackson noted this wartime context meant **controlling or freezing enemy property**, not raising revenue - underscoring that **IEEPA's origins were defensive, not fiscal.**

> Sauer: wartime presidents imposed export controls (e.g., on cotton) and used tariff-equivalent powers to restrict trade with enemies.  
> Jackson: that was about *prohibition*, not *taxation*.

### 2. Justice Barrett - Revenue Raisers and Exactions
Barrett pressed the key distinction: when does an **"exaction of money"** become a **tax** rather than a regulatory tool?  
She invoked *Algonquin*, noting that the Court allowed monetary exactions to control import quantities, but only in statutes that expressly dealt with tariffs.

> Barrett: "Algonquin said Congress could use the exaction of money to control quantity... so why isn't that the same here?"  
> Gutman: "Because IEEPA never mentions tariffs - context matters."

---

### 3. Justice Kavanaugh - The "Donut Hole" Hypothetical  
Kavanaugh highlighted the statute's asymmetry: under respondents' reading, the President could **ban all trade** but **not impose a 1% tariff** - an absurd result, he said.  
Gutman replied humorously:  
> "It's not a donut hole; it's a different kind of pastry."  

Kavanaugh also noted past presidents have used tariffs as **foreign policy tools** - for example, **tariffs against India** during the Ukraine-Russia conflict - to illustrate how the power might operate pragmatically.

---

### 4. Justice Alito - Revenue as Incidental, Not Intentional  
Alito explored whether tariffs might be legitimate if their **primary goal is behavioral**, not fiscal.  
> "If the President's goal is to change foreign conduct, and raising revenue is incidental, is that permissible?"  

Katyal replied that intent matters: tariffs are still **revenue-raising on their face**, and Article I requires explicit delegation for any tax measure - even if no funds are ultimately collected.

---

### 5. Barrett on *Algonquin* and the Scope of Monetary Exactions  
Barrett revisited *Algonquin* (1976) and the **Trade Expansion Act**, asking whether "adjust imports" and "regulate importation" could be functionally equivalent.  
She noted that **Congress in 232 statutes used tariff-related terms**, while **IEEPA did not** - making context decisive.  
>Barrett: "It's natural to read 'adjust imports' to include tariffs when the statute deals with tariffs. But unnatural here."

---

### 6. Historical Presidential Practices - What "Regulate Importation" Meant  
Justices discussed past executive uses of "regulate importation" under TWEA and IEEPA:
- **Embargoes** (total prohibitions on enemy trade)  
- **Quotas** (quantitative limits)  
- **Licensing regimes** (requiring permission to trade)

These were all **controls on conduct**, not fiscal exactions. None involved raising revenue.  

> Gutman: "Embargoes and quotas are fundamentally different from tariffs - they don't raise money."

---

### 7. Hypotheticals - Climate Change and Other Emergencies  
Several Justices raised hypotheticals testing IEEPA's breadth:
- Could a President declare **climate change** a national emergency and impose tariffs on carbon-intensive imports?  
- Could "import regulation" extend to consumer goods or services in peacetime emergencies?  
These questions probed the **Major Questions Doctrine**, testing whether Congress truly meant to delegate vast economic power implicitly.

---

### 8. Verbs vs. Nouns - "License" vs. "Licensing"  
A textual debate arose over IEEPA's phrasing: the President may act "by means of **instructions, licenses, or otherwise**."  
Barrett noted that "license" is a **noun** - implying a **permission structure**, not a revenue instrument.  
> Barrett: "If Congress meant tariffs, it could have said so. Why not 'tariffs, duties, or otherwise'?"  
Katyal: "Reading 'license' as hiding a trillion-dollar tax power would be extraordinary."

---

### 9. Tariffing Allies like Switzerland  
Katyal criticized the administration's use of IEEPA tariffs against **Switzerland**, a country with which the U.S. runs a **39% trade surplus**, as proof of overreach.  
> "No President has ever had power to tariff allies with surpluses. To say Congress implied that authority in 1977 is implausible."

This underscored the **Major Questions** theme: enormous economic consequences require clear congressional approval.

---

### 10. Fiscal Stakes - $90 Billion at Risk  
According to the **Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget**, of the **$195 billion** in tariffs collected under the IEEPA measures, **$90 billion** could be refunded or invalidated if the Court strikes down the program.  
This reinforces the **Article I, Section 8** concern: the power to tax and collect revenue originates with Congress, not the Executive.

---

### Doctrinal Undercurrents
- **Nondelegation vs. Major Questions:** whether implicit emergency powers can justify explicit taxing outcomes.  
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Delegation:** contrast between tariff-specific statutes (Sections 232, 301, 201) and the broad IEEPA language.  
- **Taxation from the People (Article I):** the Framers' requirement of bicameralism and presentment for any tax measure.  
- **Article II Foreign Affairs:** whether deference abroad can justify executive fiscal measures at home.
