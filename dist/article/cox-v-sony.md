# Cox v. Sony: Can ISPs Be Liable for Customer Copyright Infringement?

**Case:** Cox Communications, Inc. v. Sony Music Entertainment, et al.  
**Case Number:** 24-171  
**Oral Argument Date:** December 1, 2025

## The Question

Whether Internet service providers can face copyright liability for providing service to customers they know are infringing, or whether safe harbor protections under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act shield them from suit.

---

## The Arguments

### Cox's Position

Cox argues it cannot be held liable for its customers' illegal conduct merely for failing to terminate their service. Counsel E. Joshua Rosenkranz stated: "The Fourth Circuit held that a provider of basic communications infrastructure to millions of homes and businesses can be held liable because it did not kick enough accused infringers off the Internet."

Rosenkranz emphasized that neither copyright law nor tort law permits this theory. He cited *Twitter v. Taamneh*, where the Supreme Court held there is no duty requiring service providers "to terminate customers after discovering that the customers were using the service for illegal ends."

The critical point: providing generic internet service is fundamentally passive. Knowledge that some customers infringe does not transform that service into active inducement.

### Sony's Position

Sony argues Cox's conduct crosses from passive to culpable. The company provided ongoing service to "habitual abusers"—customers Cox itself identified as repeat infringers—knowing infringement would continue.

Counsel Paul D. Clement stated the distinction plainly: a "one-and-done sale of an item that can be used in a way to infringe but is generally used lawfully" differs fundamentally from providing service "to known infringers with substantial knowledge that what they themselves called habitual abusers would continue to infringe."

Clement highlighted admissions in the record that Cox employees disregarded copyright law. He argued Cox's position would render the DMCA "a dead letter" if ISPs could "take tens of thousands of copyright notices and throw them in the trash" with no consequences.

## Core Legal Tension

The Court grappled with a straightforward but elusive question: **What separates passive enablement from culpable material contribution?**

### The Inducement Standard

Under *Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios v. Grokster* (2005), secondary liability requires that a defendant act with the purpose of fostering infringement. This demands more than knowledge—it requires intent directed at promoting violations.

Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart emphasized this during argument: "Both in copyright law and more generally, this form of secondary liability is reserved for persons who act for the purpose of facilitating violations of law. Because Cox simply provided the same generic Internet services to infringers and non-infringers alike, there is no basis for inferring such a purpose here."

### Knowledge Versus Purpose

Justice Elena Kagan pressed Cox on whether corporate conduct matters at all. Rosenkranz conceded: Cox could be "the worst corporate citizen of all time and still it doesn't matter, that there would be no liability." What matters legally is purpose, not degree of responsibility.

This raises a paradox Justice Kagan identified: if Cox wins, why would ISPs continue cooperating with copyright holders through notice systems? Clement replied that willful blindness—deliberate refusal to read takedown notices—could itself satisfy the standard for aiding and abetting.

## The DMCA Safe Harbor Problem

The DMCA § 512 provides a limited liability safe harbor for ISPs that meet four conditions: lack knowledge of infringement, lack financial benefit from it, implement a repeat infringer policy, and respond expeditiously to takedown notices.

But the statute assumes some relationship between compliance and liability. If there is no liability for habitual infringement, why have safe harbors at all?

Clement highlighted the tension: "Why bother with a safe harbor? Why limit liability... if there's no liability to limit?"

---

## Critical Hypotheticals

Justice Elena Jackson posed the hardest case: a customer directly tells Cox "I am addicted to infringing on the Internet. I've been sued before... and Cox, based on where I live, is my only option."

Rosenkranz acknowledged it "pushes the envelope" but held his ground: Cox would bear no liability even in that scenario. Direct infringement suits against the customer remain available.

Justice Jackson followed with a common law question: Would ordinary aiding-and-abetting principles suffice? Rosenkranz said no—common law, like copyright, requires "a culpable act."

---

## Stakes

This case will determine whether copyright law treats internet service as a commodity (with passive protection) or as a potential partner in infringement when knowledge and ongoing relationship are present.

If Cox prevails, ISPs have broad legal room to ignore repeat infringement. If Sony prevails, ISPs must actively police customers or risk significant liability, potentially reshaping how internet service operates and costs scale.
