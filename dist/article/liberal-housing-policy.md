# How Many Brains to Make a Tank Think?

- Bribing homeowners w/ $1000 for YIMBY?
- Military style modular?
- 50-year mortgages?

The Center for American Progress thinks you deserve to live where you want. They propose bribery to get it. Build homes or else. If cities don't build enough homes, the government will bribe existing homeowners to build homes, then subsidize rents with the bribery money. 

> Ezra Klein argues that America's housing crisis stems from a shortage of 2-5 million homes, driven by insufficient construction relative to population. Home prices have risen 50% since 2020, and median first-time homebuyers are now 40 years old (vs. 31 in 2014). The core issue: America is building fewer homes per capita than in 1975.

Meanwhile, on the demand side, young entrepreneurs at **Realer Estate** are fascilitating the hunt for cheap units in NYC.

Realer Estate demonstrates that sometimes the solutions come from people who are actually trying to survive. They build things out of necessity while the surplus elite just wants to live where they want and complain about it in the New York Times so Democrats can insert more government into the problem.

> By the time you build 5 million homes, demographics will have changed. Take all the money from think tank solutions and dump it back in people's pockets. Rescind all government-led affordablity initiatives and let innovators innovate. They'll build more housing and think of better solutions.
