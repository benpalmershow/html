## It’s not a donut hole; it’s a different kind of pastry.

The Supreme Court's oral arguments on Trump v. VOS exposed a fundamental split: **Can Article II conduct foreign policy through fiscal measures without Article I?**

### The Skeptics
Justice Barrett's absurdity test: the President can ban all trade under IEEPA but cannot impose a 1% tariff? That's backwards from every delegation principle in administrative law.

Justice Kavanaugh called it the "donut hole"—a gaping logical inconsistency in the government's position.

### The Stakes
- **$195 billion** in tariffs collected under IEEPA authority
- **$90 billion** potentially refundable if struck down
- **Major Questions Doctrine** looming: Congress wouldn't have intended to delegate a trillion-dollar economic power implicitly

### The Core Question
Does "regulate importation" (1977 language) include the power to tax goods, or only to prohibit/restrict trade via embargoes and quotas?

Katyal's answer: Congress knew how to say "tariffs" (it did in 232, 301, 201 statutes). IEEPA's silence is deafening.
