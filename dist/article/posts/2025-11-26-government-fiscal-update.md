### **$38,360,841,844,745.79**


October brought a steep divergence in U.S. fiscal metrics. While interest payments on the national debt spiked dramatically and overall debt continued its sharp climb, federal tax revenue fell significantly short of September's exceptional performance.

**Why the Interest Spike?**

October's interest spike was amplified by a 43-day government shutdown that ran through mid-November, forcing the Treasury to accelerate interest payments (normally due in early November) into October to avoid default. This timing shift inflated October's interest figure and suppressed November's by roughly $20-25B. Adjusting for this anomaly, the underlying interest trend shows debt service costs climbing steadily as Treasury yields remain elevated. The sharp revenue decline is seasonal—September benefited from quarterly estimated tax payments that don't recur monthly. The cumulative result: a widening deficit and accelerating debt growth. Treasury debt increased 0.84% month-over-month, or roughly $320.7B in new borrowing.
