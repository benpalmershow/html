### **Rent Control**

New York's affordable housing stock faces a cascade of financial defaults unless the city acts on policy reforms. Over 50% of affordable buildings have expenses exceeding rental income, jeopardizing both tenants and the city's bond rating.

**The Problem:**
- 56% of Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects citywide show negative cash flow
- 63,700 units (56% of 112,000 reviewed) operate at deficits
- 16% of rental projects at high risk of default, up from 8% in four years
- Insurance costs surged 103% over four years; water rates up 21.5%
- RGB rent increases averaged below 2% annually while expenses grew 4.1%+

**What's at Stake:**
A $1 billion default cascade would crater the Housing Development Corporation's bond rating, raising borrowing costs citywide and halting the mayor's affordable housing plan. Mayor-elect Mamdani's proposed rent freeze will worsen deficits without corresponding revenue reforms.

**Required Solutions:**
Revenue increases (regulatory resets for vacant units, expanded rental assistance, housing stability court for nonpayment), debt restructuring ($1B financing program), and expense cuts (insurance captive, water rate relief, J-51 tax abatement reform).
