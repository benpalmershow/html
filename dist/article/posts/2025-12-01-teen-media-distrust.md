###  **The Kids Know**

A News Literacy Project study finds most teenagers harbor significant distrust in journalism and lack understanding of how reporting works. The findings underscores what researchers describe as "overwhelming cynicism" among a generation growing up with skepticism toward the press.

The report drew coverage from major outlets including Neiman Lab, Columbia Journalism Review, Education Week, and CNN's Reliable Sources. 

>When asked to think of one thing they think journalists are doing well, roughly 1 in 3 teens (37%) offer negative feedback, saying things such as lying and deceiving (81 responses) or that journalists don’t do anything well (66 responses).

**Key Findings:**
- 75% of teens distrust journalism
- 60% believe news is biased
- 50% think news is fake
- 40% think news is unreliable
- 30% think news is not important
