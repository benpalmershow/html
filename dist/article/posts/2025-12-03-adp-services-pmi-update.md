### **More Ounces into More Bodies More Often**

San Francisco's landmark lawsuit against major food manufacturers exposes the deliberate design of ultra-processed foods to be addictive, particularly targeting children.

The San Francisco City Attorney filed a sweeping lawsuit against eleven major food manufacturers—Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestlé, ConAgra, Mars, Post Holdings, Kellanov, and WK Kellogg Co.—alleging systematic exploitation of addiction science and predatory marketing to children.

**Key allegations:**
- **Addiction by Design:** Companies deliberately engineered products to be physiologically addictive using sensory psychologists, fMRI imaging, and roboticized taste buds. Philip Morris's explicit strategy: "control all of the pleasure drugs that are not regulated."
- **Targeted Marketing:** Over $1.6 billion annually spent on advertising to children, with specific tactics once Todd Putman (Coca-Cola's former U.S. Marketing head) described as "attack[ing] them like a bunch of wolves" when kids turned twelve.
- **Health Crisis:** Type 2 diabetes virtually nonexistent in children pre-1985; pediatric fatty liver disease tripled by 2017-2021; childhood obesity rates tripled since the 1970s.
- **Scientific Evidence:** The complaint mirrors the Surgeon General's tobacco addiction framework—demonstrating compulsive use despite harm, psychoactive effects (150-200% dopamine increase), and reinforcement patterns.

### **Services**

The services sector expanded for the third consecutive month, with the November reading of **52.6** indicating continued growth in business activity.

### **Production**

Industrial production showed stability in September, with the index holding at **101.4** after August's slight dip to 101.3. The manufacturing sector continues to show resilience despite mixed economic signals, with production levels remaining near recent highs.

**Revised Data:**
- **September:** 101.4 (+0.1% MoM)
- **August:** 101.3 (-0.3% MoM)
- **July:** 101.6 (+0.2% MoM)

**Economic Context:**
The mixed signals from employment, services, and industrial data reflect the complex economic environment. While private payroll growth has slowed, both the services sector and industrial production show stability and modest expansion. This suggests a more balanced economic picture than the employment data alone would indicate, with services and manufacturing providing counterbalancing strength.
