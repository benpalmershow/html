Omar El Akkad's 2025 National Book Award winner examines Western complicity in global atrocities and the moral fracture experienced by those who believed in liberal ideals. This powerful nonfiction memoir challenges the convenient fictions that allow empires to avoid accountability, tracing how entire populations become invisible to systems built to exploit them.

> Rules, conventions, morals, reality itself: all exist so long as their existence is convenient to the preservation of power. Otherwise, they, like all else, are expendable."
