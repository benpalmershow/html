### <i data-lucide='home' class='post-icon'></i> **Existing Home Sales Accelerate**

November existing home sales rose to $4.13M, marking a 0.5% monthly gain from October's $4.11M. The uptick signals modest momentum in housing activity, though the market remains constrained by affordability pressures and lingering inventory challenges.

**Latest Data:**
- **November Sales**: $4.13M (+0.5% MoM)
- **October Revision**: $4.11M (confirmed)
- **YoY Trend**: Stabilizing after seasonal fluctuations

The seasonal strength reflects typical year-end home-buying activity, but elevated mortgage rates and home prices continue to weigh on broader demand. Days on market remain elevated at 59 days, indicating homes are taking longer to transition from listed to pending status.

### <i data-lucide='trending-up' class='post-icon'></i> **Employment Trends Index Shows Caution**

The Employment Trends Index declined to 105.8 in October, down 0.4% from September's 106.24. This slowdown reflects softening in labor market momentum, with the composite measure of eight employment indicators signaling moderating job growth ahead.

**Latest Data:**
- **October ETI**: 105.8 (-0.4% MoM)
- **September ETI**: 106.24
- **Three-Month Trend**: Declining from 106.68 in August

The index remains above the critical 100 threshold, indicating continued expansion, but the downward trajectory warrants monitoring. Recent weeks have seen jobless claims stabilize around 217,600 and job openings remain elevated, suggesting the labor market is cooling gradually rather than rapidly deteriorating.
