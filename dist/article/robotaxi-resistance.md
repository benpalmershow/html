# No Drivah

As autonomous robotaxi companies push into new markets, city council members are blocking expansion through delay tactics and regulatory scrutiny. The core dispute: job displacement for rideshare drivers versus safety claims.

## Washington, D.C.

**Council Member Charles Allen** initially championed autonomous vehicles but grew frustrated by delays. A bill to legalize driverless driving stalled in committee, waiting for an overdue safety report that DDOT promised in fall 2025 but pushed to "early 2026."

Allen's public frustration: "So odd that the Washington Post Editorial Board goes after me to pass a bill allowing autonomous vehicles to enter DC's market."

Mayor Muriel Bowser hasn't issued permits for next-phase testing. Maryland Governor Wes Moore is more supportive.

## Boston

Boston's City Council hearing (July 2025) revealed deep skepticism (because we all know Boston drivahs never cut cornahs). **Councilors Henry Santana and Erin Murphy** introduced an ordinance creating an advisory council and requiring a full public study before any deployment—explicitly to protect jobs from "robotaxi takeover."

**Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge** quipped: "If every robotaxi drives like a confused out-of-state tourist, we will very quickly find them unwelcome on the streets of Boston."

His concern: only 40% of robotaxi miles in San Francisco are "productive" (rest are empty repositioning), companies won't share internal data, and Boston's narrow streets and winter weather present unproven challenges.

## Minneapolis

**Council Member Jamal Osman**: "It will put thousands of people out of work." He emphasized the impact on immigrants and communities of color dependent on ride-sharing income.

**Council Vice President Aisha Chughtai** supports an outright ban: "I want to see the strongest possible regulation of this."

**Council Member Robin Wonsley** recalled the Uber/Lyft entry a decade ago as cautionary: "I have no intention of repeating those mistakes."

## The Labor Push

**Autumn Weintraub** (App Drivers Union): "Drivers are people. ... They could lose their jobs to an empty seat."

**Jack Kenslea** (UFCW Local 1445): "What that really means is that the money is taken out of the pockets of the hardworking drivers... and putting it into the pockets of Google and robotaxi executives who are just going to laugh all the way to the bank."

Industry reps argue new job types will offset losses. This claim hasn't swayed council members.

## Regulatory Delay

Rather than outright bans, cities are using:
- Mandatory advisory councils and studies
- Delays in permitting and safety approvals
- State-level legislative uncertainty

If this holds, robotaxi companies will face 12-24 month delays per market.

## Opposition Summary

**Minneapolis:** Jamal Osman, Aisha Chughtai, Robin Wonsley  
**Boston:** Henry Santana, Erin Murphy, Jascha Franklin-Hodge  
**D.C.:** Charles Allen
