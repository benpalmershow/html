# How can we drive more ounces into more bodies more often?

The San Francisco City Attorney filed a sweeping lawsuit against Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestlé, ConAgra, Mars, Post Holdings, Kellanov, and WK Kellogg Co.

The complaint alleges that these companies deliberately designed ultra-processed foods (UPF) to be addictive, targeted children with marketing, and concealed health consequences. Philip Morris entered the food industry with explicit addiction science expertise. Its Director of Applied Research distilled the company's philosophy: "control all of the pleasure drugs that are not regulated." (San Francisco City Attorney Complaint, ¶ 112, p. 25)

## The Addiction Science

The complaint marshals evidence across three criteria the U.S. Surgeon General used to classify tobacco as addictive:

**1. Compulsive use despite harm.** Patients with diet-related diseases consume UPF despite needing dietary restriction. Rats exposed to industrially-produced sweets show greater resistance to electric shock than when accessing methamphetamine.

**2. Psychoactive effects.** When UPF was surgically inserted into patients' guts, dopamine levels increased 150-200%—independent of taste, smell, or touch. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf testified that medications for opioid and heroin addiction (naltrexone, pexacerfont) effectively reduce cravings for UPF.

**3. Reinforcement.** Adults and children consume UPF when satiated. Daily consumers develop increased willingness to work for UPF over time, a pattern absent with non-UPF foods.


## Health Crisis in Children

- **Type 2 Diabetes**: Virtually non-existent in children before 1985; rates skyrocketed from 2001–2017. Projections estimate sevenfold increase by 2060.
- **Pediatric fatty liver disease**: Only a handful of cases before 2000; nearly tripled by 2017–2021.
- **Childhood obesity**: Rates tripled since the 1970s.

## Marketing to Children & Artificial Dyes

Defendants spent $1.6+ billion annually on advertising to children (by 2006), with $870 million directed at children under 12. Philip Morris's CFO declared in 1987: "We've decided to focus our marketing on kids, where we know our strength is greatest." (San Francisco City Attorney Complaint, ¶ 167, p. 36; citing Hans Storr, Remarks to First Boston Beverage Tobacco Conference, April 1, 1987)

Coca-Cola set out to drive individual consumption higher than milk and water. Todd Putman, Coca-Cola's former head of U.S. Marketing, articulated the goal: "How can we drive more ounces into more bodies more often?" (San Francisco City Attorney Complaint, ¶ 170, p. 37; citing Michael Moss, *Salt Sugar Fat*, 2013, p. 110) Children were a major target. According to Putman, "when they would turn twelve, we'd suddenly attack them like a bunch of wolves" with marketing campaigns. (¶ 170, p. 37; citing Moss, p. 111)

Coca-Cola internally acknowledged the predatory logic. A 2005 internal report on targeting children stated: "Teens are at a crucial stage on the learning curve of 'how to be me.'" (¶ 171, p. 37; citing Clinkin Research, *Convenience Teens Building Loyalty with the Next Generation*, Coca Cola Leadership Council, 2005) The company's rationale was to create lifelong consumers.

When Jeffrey Dunn, Coca-Cola President and COO of North and South America, suggested the company stop marketing in public schools, he was called "an embarrassment to the company" and fired shortly thereafter. (¶ 172, p. 37)

The industry used petroleum-derived artificial dyes (Red 40, Yellow 6) to appeal to children. Defendants resisted removal despite evidence of behavioral harm. Kellogg pledged removal by 2018 but broke the promise; Mars committed to removing titanium dioxide by 2021, then reversed course.

## Formulation for Addiction

The purpose was explicit: "to understand how to exploit the physiological structures of the human brain, to override the body's natural mechanisms for resisting its addictive qualities, and to evade the body's ability to control intake." (San Francisco City Attorney Complaint, ¶ 120, p. 26)

Defendants employed sensory psychologists, fMRI brain imaging, and roboticized taste buds to optimize products. PepsiCo uses robots fitted with human taste buds hardwired into computers to simulate neurochemical responses. Nestlé employs sensory psychologists studying "taste development, perception and food preference in young children." Philip Morris and Kraft conducted joint research into "drivers of acceptance, mood or satiety/drinkability" that "are usually not consciously perceived … but are perceived at the receptor level (ex. Pheromones)." (¶ 122, p. 26)

Kool-Aid's marketing loyalty program, the "Wacky Warehouse," was described by Philip Morris's beverage division director as "our version of the Marlboro Country Store." (¶ 185, p. 39) A Philip Morris analysis called it "the most effective kid's marketing vehicle known." (¶ 185, p. 39)

## Legal Theory

The complaint asserts two causes of action: (1) violation of California's Unfair Competition Law, and (2) public nuisance. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief, statutory civil penalties, and abatement relief.
