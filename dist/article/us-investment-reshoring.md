# Trump Tariffs Spark Reshoring Wave

Trump's tariff threat is working. Multinationals are committing tens of billions to U.S. manufacturing to avoid import duties and secure market access.

## Why It Works

Tariffs (10-25% on imports) + logistics savings + government credits (IRA, CHIPS Act) now make U.S. manufacturing cost-competitive vs. China despite 3-5x higher labor costs.

**The Signal:** First-mover advantage. Government procurement preference. Supply chain risk premium. Tariff regime treated as permanent by corporate boards.

**The Scale:** $150B+ committed. Another $200B+ pipeline. 50K-100K manufacturing jobs expected by 2027.

## The Risk

Reshoring only sticks if tariffs remain. Future policy reversal or recession could crater investments.
