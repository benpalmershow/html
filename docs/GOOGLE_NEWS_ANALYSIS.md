## Detailed Assessment by Google News Ranking Factors

### 1. **Relevance** ✅ 
- Articles have clear keywords, structured topics, descriptive titles
- Categories match common news interests (legal, policy, finance)

### 2. **Location** ⚠️
- Site targets US audience (language, topics, timezone)
- Could add location meta tags if targeting specific regions
- Consider adding: `<meta name="news_keywords" content="economy, policy, legal, markets">`

### 3. **Prominence** ⚠️
- **Issue:** You're a solo publisher with limited syndication
- **Signal:** Original reporting on Supreme Court cases (good)
- **Missing:** No backlinks from major news outlets visible in your content
- **Recommendation:** Add citations to your coverage; reference other sources explicitly

### 4. **Authoritativeness** ⚠️
- **Strength:** Clear author (Ben Palmer), consistent voice
- **Weakness:** No visible author bio/credentials on news.html
- **Fix:** Add author schema to individual articles with link to author bio

```json
"author": {
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Ben Palmer",
  "url": "https://howdystranger.net",
  "description": "Independent commentator and economic analyst"
}
```

### 5. **Freshness** ✅
- Regular publishing schedule (multiple articles per month)
- Recent articles (Dec 2025 content visible)
- Timestamps present on all articles

### 6. **Usability** ✅
- Mobile-responsive CSS
- Fast load times (preload strategies visible)
- Accessible navigation
- No reported paywall issues

### 7. **Trustworthiness** ⚠️
- **Need:** Add byline directly on article pages (currently in metadata only)
- **Need:** Add publication date prominently in article view
- **Need:** Add "Updated on" if article is revised
- **Good:** Clear about being commentary/analysis vs. news reporting

---

## Current Content Structure Analysis

### News.html Page Elements
```
✅ Valid meta tags (description, keywords)
✅ Open Graph tags
✅ Twitter Card tags  
✅ Canonical URL
✅ RSS feed link: <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/news-feed.xml">
✅ NewsArticle schema (dynamically injected on article view)
✅ Organization schema
```

### Article Metadata in JSON
```json
{
  "id": "slaughter-v-trump",
  "title": "Slaughter v. Trump",
  "category": "legal",
  "date": "2025-12-09",
  "summary": "...",
  "resources": [...]
}
```

**What's missing for Google News:**
- `author` field
- `image` field (featured image)
- `byline` field
- `update_date` field
- `section` field (more granular than category)
- `keywords` array

### Suggested Enhanced Schema
```json
{
  "id": "slaughter-v-trump",
  "title": "Slaughter v. Trump",
  "author": "Ben Palmer",
  "category": "legal",
  "keywords": ["Supreme Court", "constitutional law", "executive power"],
  "date": "2025-12-09T00:00:00Z",
  "updated": "2025-12-09T00:00:00Z",
  "summary": "Supreme Court oral argument examining constitutional limits on presidential power...",
  "image": "https://howdystranger.net/images/articles/slaughter-v-trump.webp",
  "articleBody": "Full article content...",
  "resources": [...]
}
```

## Policy Compliance Assessment

### Google News Publisher Policies

| Policy | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Transparency about ownership | ✅ PASS | Ben Palmer clearly identified |
| Author attribution | ⚠️ PARTIAL | In metadata, not visible on article page |
| No misrepresentation | ✅ PASS | Honest about being commentary/analysis |
| No spam/auto-generated | ✅ PASS | Human-written original content |
| Original reporting required | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Mostly analysis; some original legal reporting |
| No deceptive practices | ✅ PASS | Clean, straightforward design |
| No fake news | ✅ PASS | Factual, sourced |
| Regular updates | ✅ PASS | Multiple articles per month |

**Potential issue:** If Google News interprets this as "independent commentary" rather than "news," it may not be eligible for general news rankings. However, it could still appear in:
- Niche vertical (legal news)
- Topic-specific results
- "Full coverage" for major stories
