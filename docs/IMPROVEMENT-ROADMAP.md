# Website Improvement Roadmap

Based on design tools: **Jitter, Rive, After Effects, Blender, Figma**

## Phase 1: Micro-Animations ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Logo entrance with bounce/fade-in animation
- [x] Word-by-word reveal for subtitle text
- [x] Card hover lift effects
- [x] Parallax scroll on hero section
- [x] Glassmorphism card design

## Phase 2: Interactive Hero Section
- [ ] **Animated subtitle improvements** - Enhanced text reveal with better timing
- [ ] **Custom cursor interactions** - Custom cursor animations on hover states
- [ ] **Icon animations refinement** - Selective animation for key icons only

## Phase 3: Visual Hierarchy & Design
- [ ] **Gradient overlays** - Modernize flat backgrounds with subtle gradients
- [ ] **Custom scrollbar** - Branded teal/orange themed scrollbars
- [ ] **Category badges** - Animated pill-style badges for news categories
- [ ] **Button states** - Enhanced hover/active states with micro-animations

## Phase 4: 3D Elements (Blender Integration)
- [ ] **3D logo variant** - WebGL 3D rotating logo for premium feel
- [ ] **Depth layers** - Subtle 3D card lift effects
- [ ] **Background particles** - Subtle floating geometric shapes

## Phase 5: Figma → Code Enhancements
- [ ] **Design system tokens** - Extract CSS variables into structured design tokens
- [ ] **Component variants** - Create dynamic button/card states
- [ ] **Auto-layout patterns** - Improve responsive grid consistency

## Phase 6: Advanced Animations (Rive/Lottie)
- [ ] **Rive interactive components** - State machine-driven UI elements
- [ ] **Lottie loaders** - Replace static loading with animated JSON
- [ ] **Page transitions** - Smooth navigation with shared-element transitions

## Phase 7: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Animation performance audit** - Measure and optimize frame rates
- [ ] **Lazy-load animations** - Conditionally load animation libraries
- [ ] **Reduce motion preferences** - Enhanced accessibility support

## Current Focus: Logo Entrance Refinement

**Goal:** Perfect the logo entrance animation with professional-grade timing and easing.

**Specs:**
- Duration: 1.2s → 1.5s (more dramatic)
- Easing: Add elastic bounce effect
- Scale: 0.8 → 1.0 with overshoot
- Blur: 10px → 0px with smooth transition
- Add rotation: -5deg → 0deg for playful entrance

**Tools:**
- Motion One library
- CSS custom properties for timing
- RequestAnimationFrame for smoothness
