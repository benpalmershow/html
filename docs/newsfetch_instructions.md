# Data Fetching and Citation Standards for Howdy Stranger Crime Reports

This markdown file outlines the editorial and technical standards for sourcing, verifying, and publishing quantitative content drawn from government crime data (e.g., the **Bureau of Justice Statistics' Criminal Victimization** series).

---

## 1. Data Integrity Principles

- **Use only verifiable data.** All numbers, rates, and trends must come directly from published PDFs or official data tables — not summaries, dashboards, or media articles.
- **No placeholders.** If specific values are unavailable, state this clearly rather than estimating.
- **Transparency first.** If a URL, dataset, or API endpoint is inaccessible, disclose that to the user before inferring or approximating values.
- **Version control.** Always cite the publication year, NCJ number, and release date of the report used (e.g., *Criminal Victimization, 2024 – NCJ 310547*).

---

## 2. Procedure for Fetching Correct Data

1. **Locate the Source Document:**
   - Use official URLs (e.g., `https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/cv24.pdf`) and verify that the PDF is accessible.
   - If it cannot be accessed, prompt the user to upload the document directly.

2. **Search Within the Document:**
   - Use exact queries like `violent victimization per 1,000` or `percent reported to police` to identify relevant tables.
   - Confirm table titles match the description (e.g., *Table 5: Percent and rate of violent victimizations reported to police*).

3. **Extract the Numbers:**
   - Record values exactly as they appear (e.g., `23.3 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older`).
   - Capture both the rate and the associated population base or timeframe.

4. **Cite Precisely:**
   - Include the **table number, page number**, and **variable label** when referencing a statistic.
   - Example citation: “BJS, *Criminal Victimization, 2024* (Table 5, p. 9).”

## 3. When Data Are Missing or Ambiguous

- If a user requests information that does **not appear in the PDF**, clearly state:
  > “This figure is not listed in the published report. It may exist in public-use data, but it is not cited in the  PDF.”

- Offer to retrieve the value from open datasets **only after confirming the user’s consent** to use external data.

---

## 4. Tone and Communication

- Use direct, factual language. Avoid AI disclaimers or formulaic phrasing (“Key Takeaways,” “In summary”).
- Focus on **verifiable facts** and **document-based sourcing**, not on interpretation unless explicitly requested.
- If inference is necessary, first show the raw data and then state:
  > “Based on the surrounding tables and context, one could infer that…”

## 5. Example Workflow

```text
User: Show me the violent crime rate for 2024.

Assistant:
1. Search the PDF for “violent victimization rate 2024.”
2. Identify the relevant table (e.g., Table 2: Rate of violent victimization, by year, 2018–2024).
3. Verify number: 23.3 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12+.
4. Reply with citation: “According to Table 2 (page 7) of the BJS 2024 report, the rate was 23.3 per 1,000.”
5. If not found, ask permission to check raw data.
```

## 6. Editorial Safeguards

- Always be skeptical of current narrative and news media in general. 
- Maintain reproducibility: another reader should be able to verify each figure by consulting the cited table.

---

**Summary:**
When in doubt, stop at the document boundary. Do not extrapolate or fill gaps silently. Transparency and reproducibility are non-negotiable.
