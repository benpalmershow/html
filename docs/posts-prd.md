# Posts Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

The Posts system is a core component of the TBPS website, serving as a chronological feed of updates, insights, and content additions across various categories including financial data, news, media recommendations, and journal entries. Posts provide real-time updates to users about new content and key developments.

## Objectives

- Maintain a consistent, professional presentation of information
- Enable easy navigation to relevant sections of the site
- Provide value through timely, accurate, and engaging content
- Ensure accessibility and mobile-friendly formatting

## Post Structure

Each post is a JSON object in `json/posts.json` with the following required fields:

```json
{
  "date": "MM/DD/YY",
  "content": "HTML-formatted string"
}
```

### Date Format
- Use format: MM/DD/YY (e.g., "10/29/25" for October 29, 2025)
- Dates should be in chronological order (newest first)
- Use future dates for scheduled content

### Content Format
- HTML string supporting basic tags: `<b>`, `<br>`, `<a>`, `<i>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- Icons via Lucide icons: `<i data-lucide='icon-name' class='post-icon'></i>`
- Images: Use cover images from media.json for media posts, styled with width/height and float for layout; music images styled as circular spinning records (border-radius: 50%, animation: spin)
- Stock tickers: Link to Yahoo Finance pages (e.g., https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TICKER) with target="_blank" and rel="noopener"
- Links should use relative paths and include `target="_blank"` for external links

## Content Formatting Guidelines

### Structure
- **Title/Icon**: Start with an icon and bold title
- **Body**: Main content with line breaks (`<br><br>`) for spacing
- **Links**: End with relevant navigation links
- **Multiple Sections**: Use line breaks to separate distinct topics within one post

### Typography
- Use `<b>` for emphasis and titles
- Use bullet points (`•`) for lists instead of `<ul>`
- Keep descriptions concise (2-3 sentences max)
- Avoid excessive formatting or emojis

### Icons
- Always include a relevant Lucide icon at the start
- Use `class='post-icon'` for consistent styling
- Common icons:
  - `bar-chart-3`: Financial data
  - `newspaper`: News
  - `film`: Movies/media
  - `book`: Books
  - `music`: Music
  - `football`: Sports
  - `trending-up/trending-down`: Economic indicators
  - `cpu`: Technology/AI
  - `gavel`: Legal news
  - `home`: Housing/real estate
  - `dollar-sign`: Money/economics

## Categories

Posts should fit into one or more categories:

### Financial
- Economic indicators (CPI, PMI, employment, etc.)
- Market data and predictions
- Budget and debt updates

### News
- IPOs and corporate news
- Policy and legal developments
- Industry trends

## Links and Navigation

### Internal Links
- Use relative paths (e.g., `financials.html`, `news.html`)
- For media items, link to specific cards using anchors (e.g., `media.html#holy-spider`)
- For media sections, use filter parameters (e.g., `media.html?filter=movie` for movies)
- For news articles, use article parameters (e.g., `news.html?article=fomc-may-meeting`)
- For journal entries, use title-based anchors (e.g., `journal.html#prognostication-masturbation`)
- Include descriptive anchor text
- Add filters when appropriate (e.g., `?filter=Consumer%20Indicators`)
- Make images clickable by wrapping in `<a>` tags when linking to media cards

### External Links
- Use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener"` for security
- Prefer official sources (government sites, company filings)
- Include context about what the link contains

## Post Improvement Checklist

When improving a post, follow this checklist:

1. **Identify Post Type**: Determine category (Financial, News, Media, Journal, Announcement)
2. **Add Icon**: Select appropriate Lucide icon from the guidelines
3. **Create Title**: Craft a clear, bold title (e.g., <b>Title Here</b>)
4. **Write Description**: Provide concise, informative description (2-3 sentences max)
5. **Link Stock Tickers**: If present, link to Yahoo Finance with target="_blank" and rel="noopener"
6. **Add Images**: For media posts, include cover images with circular styling and float layout
7. **Create Anchors**: Link to specific content using appropriate anchor format:
   - Media: media.html#slug
   - News: news.html?article=slug
   - Journal: journal.html#slug
8. **Separate Topics**: If post covers multiple topics, use separate sections with individual icons/titles
9. **Remove Emojis**: Eliminate informal emojis for professional appearance
10. **Test Links**: Ensure all links work and point to correct locations

- Use informal language or excessive exclamation points

✓ **DO:**
- Write engaging, story-driven descriptions
- Link to specific positions on pages (#anchors, ?article=, ?filter=)
- Include cover images for all media
- Use appropriate Lucide icons
- Keep descriptions concise and compelling
- Link all tickers with target="_blank" and rel="noopener"
- Separate multi-topic posts with distinct sections
- Maintain professional, direct tone

### Quality Standards Summary

Every post represents the site's brand and quality. Posts should:

2. **Engage** - Create intrigue with compelling descriptions
3. **Navigate** - Link precisely to relevant content
4. **Delight** - Present visually with proper images and icons
5. **Perform** - Work flawlessly on all devices

This standardization work is complete. All future posts must meet these requirements without exception.</content>
</xai:function_call">The Posts PRD has been created at `/Users/benjaminpalmer/TBPS/html/html/docs/posts-prd.md` with comprehensive guidelines for structure, formatting, categories, and best practices based on the existing posts pattern. This should serve as your implementation guide for improving and maintaining the posts system. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any sections or add more details. 

Next post to improve? (The oldest ones like 5/24, 5/25, 5/28, 6/3, etc. appear to need similar formatting updates.)
