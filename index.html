        5/15/25 - Watch Holy Spider in 'üé•watch' Section with Kanopy. <p></p>
      About: Female journalist Rahimi (Zar Amir Ebrahimi) travels to the Iranian holy city of Mashhad to investigate a serial killer who believes he is doing the work of God, cleansing the streets of sinners by murdering sex workers. As the body count mounts, and Rahimi draws closer to exposing his crimes, the opportunity for justice grows harder to attain as the "Spider Killer" is embraced by many as a hero. Based on the horrific true story of serial killer Saeed Hanaei, acclaimed writer/director Ali Abbasi (Border) unveils a gripping crime thriller, and a daring indictment of a society in which rough justice is routinely a fact of life.

      5/11/25 - In the book ‚ÄúPositive Intelligence‚Äù we are taught to embrace our Sage over our Judge. 
      The Five Sage Powers are Empathy, Exploration, Innovation, Navigation, and Activation. 
      <br>As a preemptive Judge (Hyper Vigilant Saboteur), I of course was pissed at the junkie in the Mother‚Äôs Day card section who was rummaging through the cards and not moving. 
      Another card shopper with earpods in, took the situation calmly as if he didn‚Äôt notice how angry I was. 
      I later reported the junkie to security and left without a Mother‚Äôs Day card. 
      <br>Through Empathy, I thought maybe the junkie was rummaging through Mother‚Äôs Day cards because he missed his mom. 
      This man was once a young boy embraced by a loving mother. 
      <br>Through Exploration, I became curious (Fascinated Anthropologist). How does a happy boy become an addict? How many instances of grief and disappointment had this man gone through? 
       <br>Through Innovation, I thought maybe I could share this story because I still struggle with accepting the many mentally unstable individuals constantly disrupting our lives in San Francisco. 
       <br>Through Navigation, I realize no one wants to deal with them. They say they do, but the idealist judges and doesn't act. They are saboteurs, not sages. 
       <br>Through Activation, I channel Candy Lightner who lost her 13-year old daughter to a drunk driver and started MADD. The mentally ill need to be removed from the streets against their free will if they are breaking the law. The rule of law must apply to them because it‚Äôs not fair to everyone else.<p></p>

        Long shadows on a Friday night bench 
         <br>A laundromat (closed for repair) with empty windows 
           <br>An Acura parked long term. A tucked ticket. 
             <br>Clipping heals to date night. 
               <br>Gas engines purring from stop signs. 
                 <br>Wandering elderly man in sneakers, jeans, and a sweatshirt. 
                   <br>A crew, ‚Äúfor me to be happy in the city‚Ä¶‚Äù 
                     <br>Sitting still is not easy. 
                       <br>The world passes you by and it‚Äôs completely indifferent. 
                         <br>The sun feels nice and the cable cars creak; comfort in cacophony and cacophony in comfort. 
                           <br>A weird word. A weird world.
