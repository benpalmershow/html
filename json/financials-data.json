            "explanation": "The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a benchmark for interest rates across the economy. This yield represents the return an investor would receive by holding the note to maturity. The 10-year Treasury yield is influenced by Federal Reserve policy, inflation expectations, economic growth prospects, and global demand for safe assets. It serves as a reference rate for many financial products, including mortgages, corporate bonds, and auto loans. When the 10-year yield rises, borrowing costs typically increase throughout the economy. The yield curve, which plots yields across different maturities, is closely watched for signals about economic growth and potential recessions (an inverted yield curve has preceded recent recessions)."

The index is benchmarked to 100 (1966=100). Values above 90 suggest economic expansion, while values below 80 may indicate economic stress. The survey includes current conditions (40% weight) and expectations (60% weight) components. The expectations component is particularly important as it can predict future consumer spending patterns. The index is a leading indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity."

The market is influenced by factors such as sawmill capacity, transportation costs, and trade policies. Lumber futures are often used by homebuilders, construction companies, and investors to hedge against price volatility. The commodity is particularly important in North America, where wood-frame construction is common for residential housing."

            "explanation": "The price of high-grade copper futures contracts traded on the COMEX division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Copper is often called 'Dr. Copper' for its ability to predict economic trends due to its widespread use in construction, electronics, and manufacturing. Prices are quoted in US dollars per pound. Copper demand is closely tied to global industrial activity, particularly in emerging markets like China. The metal is also seen as a barometer of global economic health, with rising prices often indicating strong manufacturing activity and economic growth. Copper is highly sensitive to changes in global supply (from mining) and demand (from industrial usage), as well as inventory levels at major exchanges like the London Metal Exchange (LME)."

This key employment metric from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) includes all nonfarm business, government, and nonprofit employees. The figure is seasonally adjusted to account for predictable employment patterns. A consistent monthly addition of 100,000-150,000 jobs is typically needed to keep pace with population growth. The report also includes revisions to previous months' data and is considered a lagging indicator, reflecting labor market conditions from the reference period (usually the pay period including the 12th of the month)."

The 'headline' CPI includes food and energy prices, which can be volatile month-to-month. The 'core' CPI excludes these volatile categories to show underlying inflation trends. The Federal Reserve targets 2% annual inflation as measured by the PCE price index, but CPI is more widely reported in the media and used for cost-of-living adjustments."
