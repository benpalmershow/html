Published by the Federal Reserve, it's a key indicator of economic activity and industrial capacity utilization. The index is seasonally adjusted and expressed as a percentage of real output relative to a base year (currently 2017=100). Changes in the index reflect both cyclical and structural shifts in the economy. The manufacturing component is particularly watched as a leading indicator of economic health. The report also includes capacity utilization rates, which measure how much of the nation's industrial capacity is being used."

The LEI is expressed as an index with 2016 as the base year (2016=100). Economists and policymakers use the LEI to anticipate turning points in the economy, with a six- to nine-month lead time. The index is published monthly and is subject to revisions as more complete data becomes available. The Conference Board also produces Coincident and Lagging Economic Indexes to provide a comprehensive view of the business cycle."

This flash estimate is released about a week before the final data and is based on approximately 85% of total survey responses. The composite PMI is closely watched by economists and investors as an early indicator of economic health, as it reflects both manufacturing and services activity, which together account for the majority of economic output. The report includes sub-indices for new orders, employment, and business expectations."

            "explanation": "A leading measure of U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential housing nationwide. The index uses a repeat-sales pricing technique to measure home price appreciation, comparing the sale prices of the same properties over time. The base value of 100 represents home prices in January 2000. The index is published with a two-month lag and is considered one of the most reliable measures of U.S. home price trends. The data is seasonally adjusted and covers nine U.S. census divisions. The Case-Shiller Index is widely followed by economists, investors, and policymakers as a gauge of housing market health and homeowner wealth effects on consumer spending."

            "explanation": "The price of high-grade copper futures contracts traded on the COMEX division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Copper is often called 'Dr. Copper' for its ability to predict economic trends due to its widespread use in construction, electronics, and manufacturing. Prices are quoted in US dollars per pound. Copper demand is closely tied to global industrial activity, particularly in emerging markets like China. The metal is also seen as a barometer of global economic health, with rising prices often indicating strong manufacturing activity and economic growth. Copper is highly sensitive to changes in global supply (from mining) and demand (from industrial usage), as well as inventory levels at major exchanges like the London Metal Exchange (LME)."

Lumber prices are a key indicator for the housing and construction industries, as they directly impact building costs. Prices are quoted in US dollars per 1,000 board feet. Lumber is highly sensitive to housing market conditions, seasonal construction patterns, and weather-related supply disruptions. The market is influenced by factors such as sawmill capacity, transportation costs, and trade policies. Lumber futures are often used by homebuilders, construction companies, and investors to hedge against price volatility. The commodity is particularly important in North America, where wood-frame construction is common for residential housing."
