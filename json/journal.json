The system discourages price shopping as patients only see minimal copays, while doctors are incentivized to order unnecessary tests. Even 'preventive care' often feels like a data collection scheme, with insurance companies offering small rewards for personal health data. The solution? More transparency and questioning whether each test or prescription is truly necessary. <a href='/article/health.html'>Read more</a>"

State intervention will always have adverse market incentives. Remove the state and a Fair Market Rent and a Free Market system will fascilitate price discovery.
