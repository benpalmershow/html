"content": "I received notification that Autopilot traded new positions. It sold NVDA than bought it. Stupid (studies show the least active traders beat the busiest by 7%).<br>AI can't zoom out to provide context. It's current-info-biased. In other words its memory is based on existing code, not past experience. Sure you could code that, prompt that to say, \"act like smart investor with memory and don't sell.\" But this hyper aggressive behavior to buy and sell constantly with new models is a losing strategy. The oracle from Omaha epitomizes investor intelligence. Deep learning, longevity; sagaciousness. Coupled with AI, the individual now can discern with augmented intelligence buts it's not artificial reasoning that supersedes purchasing decisions. The human is not replaceable and is far more interesting than 'just interesting' as some prominent voices have blithely opined. While the luddites overreacted in the past, the AI-emboldened entrepreneur is now well-tooled but amorous. The modern technocrat is mired in their own myopic ideology. I find myself in this camp. Why am I building? What do I believe? It seems so futile. But maybe the despondency is misplaced. Maybe it's not 'tech' or 'no tech' or human v. robot. It's a digestible easy narrative. But maybe it's a false dichotomy. If it's about determinism and whether I can live without free will, then I submit. If all events, including human actions, are causally determined by preceding events and the laws of nature, this means that every event is the inevitable result of what came before, making it impossible to have acted otherwise. Is technological determinism incompatible with free will? <br> Do I have free will?"
