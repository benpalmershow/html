"content": "Housing market amelioration has concentrated on incurring more debt or restricting demand but not facilitating supply with intelligent governance. Proposals have included limiting large institutional ownership, extending amortization to a 50-year mortgage, tapping into your 401(k) (loans already allowed), and increasing liquidity with bond purchases for rates to go down. All aimed at the buyer and ignoring the localized supply issue. A better way to solve the \"affordability\" crisis is through deregulation. No capital gains, no rent control, streamline permitting, incentivize building. Instill pro housing ideals with policy incentives (see the bipartisan The Build Now Act from senators Kennedy and Warren). Hell, bring back ole' Build Back Better mantra!

The norm should always be to preserve innocent life; not to hasten death. Democrats smartly retort that it's not about shortening life but shortening death. But what the hell does that even mean? Life is pain. Life can be miserable. And we are all dying at a different pace. The slippery slope is to not speak truthfully about it. To dance around a hard truth is what a politician does. They are vapid; the results of an apathetic electorate. We should come to our senses before even feebly endorsing assisted suicide. We should face it directly and call it what it is. Medical aid in dying (MAID) is anesthetizing a harsh, blunt, and unpleasant end. It is the euphemism of the century. MAID may be practical and convenient. It is also an endorsement of taking innocent life. It also makes me feel empty inside. It makes me contemplate shortening my own death. I'm eventually inconvenient if not already. AI can do my job.

I can't repair my Tesla nor can I buy an affordable <a href='/news.html?article=oregon-kei-trucks-sb1213'>Kei truck</a> that doesn't require long-term financing. I can't upgrade my iPhone hardware ad hoc. My Fitbit stopped working suddenly and Google offered 35% off a newer version. Product obsolescence is planned and amortized so that my inventory loss is their revenue gain. Not upgrading your iPhone is bad for business. Same goes for not financing the house you can't afford, the large vehicle-for-one that sits 80% unused for $760 a month. Smart-anything, subscriptions, IOT dependency, BNPL financing, all requisite reoccurring revenue for 📈 in quarterly earnings presentations.

Stupid (studies show the least active traders beat the busiest by 7%).<br>AI can't zoom out to provide context. It's current-info-biased. In other words its memory is based on existing code, not past experience. Sure you could code that, prompt that to say, \"act like smart investor with memory and don't sell.\" But this hyper aggressive behavior to buy and sell constantly with new models is a losing strategy. The oracle from Omaha epitomizes investor intelligence. Deep learning, longevity; sagaciousness. Coupled with AI, the individual now can discern with augmented intelligence buts it's not artificial reasoning that supersedes purchasing decisions. The human is not replaceable and is far more interesting than 'just interesting' as some prominent voices have blithely opined. While the luddites overreacted in the past, the AI-emboldened entrepreneur is now well-tooled but amorous. The modern technocrat is mired in their own myopic ideology. I find myself in this camp. Why am I building? What do I believe? It seems so futile. But maybe the despondency is misplaced. Maybe it's not 'tech' or 'no tech' or human v. robot. It's a digestible easy narrative. But maybe it's a false dichotomy. If it's about determinism and whether I can live without free will, then I submit. If all events, including human actions, are causally determined by preceding events and the laws of nature, this means that every event is the inevitable result of what came before, making it impossible to have acted otherwise. Is technological determinism incompatible with free will? <br> Do I have free will?"
