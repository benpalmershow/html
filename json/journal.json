She states the \"broader narratives about fraud by SNAP recipients is completely false.\" The \"broad\" fraud narrative will always be false from this Berkeley-broached perspective. Until the lowly taxpayer who is working 3 jobs to pay for someone else to receive $1500/mo. is included in the narrative, it's not journalism, it's Marxist advocacy on behalf of wealthy donors who want you poor, illiterate, and subservient to their revisionist ideology."

In melancholic moments I've contemplated or ideated on the end. I get it, mental illness doesn't count. But what does count, is that there are less and less people standing in my way. And there are less and less people standing for my way. Selfishness is pragmatic. Loss is ephemeral. The bad thoughts go away eventually. We prefer to be left alone, free to our own will, autonomous until the end when we lay flat together.<br><br>In crisis management we're taught to assess risk so that suicidal ideation is properly managed and walked down. The norm should always be to preserve innocent life; not to hasten death. Democrats smartly retort that it's not about shortening life but shortening death. But what the hell does that even mean? Life is pain. Life can be miserable. And we are all dying at a different pace. The slippery slope is to not speak truthfully about it. To dance around a hard truth is what a politician does. They are vapid; the results of an apathetic electorate. We should come to our senses before even feebly endorsing assisted suicide. We should face it directly and call it what it is. Medical aid in dying (MAID) is anesthetizing a harsh, blunt, and unpleasant end. It is the euphemism of the century. MAID may be practical and convenient. It is also an endorsement of taking innocent life. It also makes me feel empty inside. It makes me contemplate shortening my own death. I'm eventually inconvenient if not already. AI can do my job.

In other words its memory is based on existing code, not past experience. Sure you could code that, prompt that to say, \"act like smart investor with memory and don't sell.\" But this hyper aggressive behavior to buy and sell constantly with new models is a losing strategy. The oracle from Omaha epitomizes investor intelligence. Deep learning, longevity; sagaciousness. Coupled with AI, the individual now can discern with augmented intelligence buts it's not artificial reasoning that supersedes purchasing decisions. The human is not replaceable and is far more interesting than 'just interesting' as some prominent voices have blithely opined. While the luddites overreacted in the past, the AI-emboldened entrepreneur is now well-tooled but amorous. The modern technocrat is mired in their own myopic ideology. I find myself in this camp. Why am I building? What do I believe? It seems so futile. But maybe the despondency is misplaced. Maybe it's not 'tech' or 'no tech' or human v. robot. It's a digestible easy narrative. But maybe it's a false dichotomy. If it's about determinism and whether I can live without free will, then I submit. If all events, including human actions, are causally determined by preceding events and the laws of nature, this means that every event is the inevitable result of what came before, making it impossible to have acted otherwise. Is technological determinism incompatible with free will? <br> Do I have free will?"
