        "content": "NYT states that 1M rent-controlled landlords net operating income was up 12.1% and that they're, 'actually doing pretty well.' Big thing missing. Just a major fact. Missing. Landlords costs are down because they're not investing in their properties. They aren't spending or are disclosing the smallest costs to justify whatever increases they can get under state control. State intervention will always have adverse market incentives. Remove the state and a Fair Market Rent and a Free Market system will fascilitate price discovery. Landlords will invest and tenants will get better deals. More compliance costs, more state intervention, and you get HIGHER PRICES."
