As the body count mounts, and Rahimi draws closer to exposing his crimes, the opportunity for justice grows harder to attain as the 'Spider Killer' is embraced by many as a hero. Based on the horrific true story of serial killer Saeed Hanaei, acclaimed writer/director Ali Abbasi (Border) unveils a gripping crime thriller, and a daring indictment of a society in which rough justice is routinely a fact of life."
