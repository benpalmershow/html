As the body count mounts, and Rahimi draws closer to exposing his crimes, the opportunity for justice grows harder to attain as the 'Spider Killer' is embraced by many as a hero. Based on the horrific true story of serial killer Saeed Hanaei, acclaimed writer/director Ali Abbasi (Border) unveils a gripping crime thriller, and a daring indictment of a society in which rough justice is routinely a fact of life."

I later reported the junkie to security and left without a Mother's Day card.<br>Through Empathy, I thought maybe the junkie was rummaging through Mother's Day cards because he missed his mom. This man was once a young boy embraced by a loving mother.<br>Through Exploration, I became curious (Fascinated Anthropologist). How does a happy boy become an addict? How many instances of grief and disappointment had this man gone through?<br>Through Innovation, I thought maybe I could share this story because I still struggle with accepting the many mentally unstable individuals constantly disrupting our lives in San Francisco.<br>Through Navigation, I realize no one wants to deal with them. They say they do, but the idealist judges and doesn't act. They are saboteurs, not sages.<br>Through Activation, I channel Candy Lightner who lost her 13-year old daughter to a drunk driver and started MADD. The mentally ill need to be removed from the streets against their free will if they are breaking the law. The rule of law must apply to them because it's not fair to everyone else."
