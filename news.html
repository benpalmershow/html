          <p><strong>Posted on July 2, 2025</strong></p>
          <p>The <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)</strong>, or H.R. 1, passed the U.S. House on May 22,
            2025, by a 215-214 vote and the Senate on July 1, 2025, by a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance
            casting the tie-breaking vote. This budget reconciliation package allocates significant funds for homeland
            security and immigration enforcement, prioritizing border security and mass deportation. Below is an
            overview of the key funding allocations based on the latest information.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Key Funding Allocations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Border Security and Infrastructure</strong>: $46.5 billion for an integrated border barrier
            system (border wall, fencing, water barriers, access roads, and sensors), $5 billion for U.S. Customs and
            Border Protection (CBP) facilities, and $4.1 billion to hire over 8,000 new CBP and Border Patrol agents.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Immigration Enforcement and Detention</strong>: $45 billion to expand Immigration and Customs
            Enforcement (ICE) detention capacity to over 100,000 beds daily, including family residential centers.
            $29.9 billion supports ICE enforcement operations, such as community arrests and state/local law
            enforcement cooperation, with $14.4 billion for transportation and removal of up to one million
            individuals annually.</li>
          <li><strong>Personnel Expansion</strong>: $10 billion to hire 10,000 additional ICE officers and support
            staff by 2029, including $858 million for retention bonuses and $600 million for recruitment.</li>
          <li><strong>Immigration Courts</strong>: $3.3 billion to the Department of Justice, with a portion for the
            Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to address court backlogs, though limited to 800
            immigration judges.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Impact and Concerns</h3>
        <p>The OBBBA allocates approximately <strong>$170 billion</strong> for homeland security and immigration
          enforcement over four years, a significant increase from prior budgets. Supporters argue it strengthens
          border security and enforces immigration laws, aligning with the administration's priorities. Critics,
          including immigration advocates, warn that the focus on enforcement over adjudication could exacerbate court
          backlogs (currently over 3.6 million cases) and raise humanitarian concerns due to expanded detention and
          deportation. The bill's passage remains contentious, with the House needing to approve the Senate's version,
          facing potential opposition from fiscal hawks over the bill's $3.3 trillion deficit increase over 10 years.

          <p><strong>Posted on July 2, 2025</strong></p>
          <p>On June 30, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom signed two landmark bills, <strong>Assembly Bill (AB)
              130</strong> and <strong>Senate Bill (SB) 131</strong>, reforming the <strong>California Environmental
              Quality Act (CEQA)</strong> to tackle the state's housing crisis and accelerate development. Below is a
            concise look at how these laws reshape CEQA.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>AB 130: Streamlining Infill Housing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exempts most <strong>infill housing projects</strong> (built in already-developed urban areas) from
            CEQA's environmental review process, provided they comply with local zoning and planning standards.</li>
          <li>Imposes a <strong>30-day deadline</strong> for agencies to approve or deny qualifying projects, speeding
            up housing construction.</li>
          <li>Applies to projects under 85 feet, with no requirements for affordable housing or labor mandates.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>SB 131: Broadening CEQA Exemptions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Expands exemptions to include projects like <strong>high-speed rail</strong>, <strong>wildfire
              mitigation</strong>, <strong>broadband</strong>, and <strong>advanced manufacturing</strong> (e.g.,
            semiconductor plants).</li>
          <li>For housing projects missing CEQA exemptions due to a single condition, limits environmental reviews to
            only that specific issue, reducing delays and costs.</li>
          <li>Exempts rezoning for state-approved housing plans.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Impact and Controversy</h3>
        <p>These reforms aim to cut bureaucratic red tape, lower housing costs, and promote climate-friendly urban
          development. However, environmental groups argue they may weaken protections for wildlife, air, and water
          quality. Both laws took effect immediately, signaling a bold shift in balancing development and
          environmental oversight in California.</p>

            <li><strong>Arguments Against:</strong> Exceed judicial authority, encourage forum shopping, prevent legal
              issue percolation.</li>
            <li><strong>Article III Limits:</strong> "Case or controversy" requirement restricts courts to resolving
              disputes between specific parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Standing & Remedial Principles:</strong> Relief should be no broader than necessary for
              plaintiffs; universal injunctions may go beyond this.</li>
            <li><strong>Separation of Powers:</strong> Universal injunctions risk courts acting like legislators.</li>

            <li>Universal injunctions raise fundamental questions about judicial power limits under Article III,
              balancing effective remedies and separation of powers.</li>
            <li>Class actions (Rule 23) offer due process safeguards; universal injunctions provide expedient but less
              protected remedies.</li>
            <li>Historical equity practices provide competing narratives about legitimacy of broad injunctions.</li>
            <li>Practical concerns about uniform federal policy implementation must be balanced against constitutional
              limits.</li>
            <li>The Supreme Court is increasingly skeptical, suggesting future restrictions on universal injunctions.

      <p><em>Federal Open Market Committee Meeting: May 6-7, 2025</em></p>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Monetary Policy Review</h3>
        <p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a joint meeting with the Board of Governors of the Federal
          Reserve System on May 6-7, 2025. During this meeting, they thoroughly reviewed their monetary policy
          strategy, tools, and communication approaches.</p>
        <p>A key outcome was the reaffirmation of their commitment to a <strong>2 percent longer-run inflation
            objective</strong>. Participants emphasized the critical importance of maintaining anchored longer-term
          inflation expectations to ensure economic stability. Discussions also compared flexible average inflation
          targeting with flexible inflation targeting, concluding that the latter represents a more robust and
          adaptable policy strategy for current economic conditions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Financial Market Developments</h3>
        <p>The manager's review of financial market developments highlighted significant volatility. Key observations
          included a rise in longer-maturity Treasury yields and a depreciating U.S. dollar. Market participants
          adjusted their forecasts, lowering GDP projections while raising inflation expectations.</p>
        <p>The Treasury yield curve steepened, and measures of Treasury market liquidity showed deterioration. While
          short-horizon inflation expectations increased modestly, longer-horizon expectations remained notably
          stable, indicating a degree of confidence in long-term price stability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Committee Actions & Economic Situation</h3>
        <p>The Committee took several actions, including voting to renew dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap
          arrangements and reciprocal currency arrangements with various central banks. They also ratified the Desk's
          domestic transactions, ensuring smooth market operations.</p>
        <p>Staff analysis of the economic situation indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat
          elevated, even as the unemployment rate stabilized at a low level. Real GDP growth experienced a step down
          in the first quarter of 2025, though labor market conditions continued to be solid overall.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Monetary Policy Considerations</h3>
        <p>In their overall consideration of monetary policy, participants consistently noted that inflation remained
          somewhat elevated. Concurrently, economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace.</p>
