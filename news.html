            DECISION BELOW: 2024 WL 5354482
            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 23-1620
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            This case presents a clear, recognized, entrenched conflict over an important
            question about the application of state procedural rules in federal court.
            Delaware, like numerous states, requires that in certain actions the plaintiff must
            also file an affidavit of merit ("AOM") with the complaint. See 18 Del. C. § 6853. An
            AOM is an affidavit signed by an expert stating that there are reasonable grounds to
            believe that each defendant has committed the alleged misconduct. See id.§ 6853(a)(l).
            The Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth circuits hold that AOM
            provisions and comparable statutes do not govern actions in federal court because they
            answer the same question as-and therefore conflict with-several different Federal Rules
            of Civil Procedure. The Third and Tenth circuits, in contrast, hold that they present "no
            conflict" with any Federal Rules.
            In the decision below, the Third Circuit, in an unpublished opinion, for at least the
            fifth time, refused to hold that an AOM statute conflicts with any Federal Rules. Judge
            Phipps "concur[red] in only the judgment." Third Circuit precedent required him to vote
            to affirm, he explained, but ''writing on a clean slate ... he may not [have] arrive[d] at that
            same conclusion."
            The question presented is:
            Whether a state law providing that a complaint must be dismissed unless it is
            accompanied by an expert affidavit may be applied in federal court.

            DECISION BELOW: 116 F.4th 1178
            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 22-1445, 23-1002
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Kaley Chiles is a licensed counselor who helps people by talking with them. A
            practicing Christian, Chiles believes that people flourish when they live consistently with
            God's design, including their biological sex. Many of her clients seek her counsel
            precisely because they believe that their faith and their relationship with God
            establishes the foundation upon which to understand their identity and desires. But
            Colorado bans these consensual conversations based on the viewpoints they express.
            Its content- and viewpoint-based Counseling Restriction prohibits counseling
            conversations with minors that might encourage them to change their "sexual orientation
            or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions," while
            allowing conversations that provide "[a]cceptance, support, and understanding for ...
            identity exploration and development, including ... [a]ssistance to a person undergoing
            gender transition." Colo. Rev. Stat. § 12- 245-202(3.5).
            The Tenth Circuit upheld this ban as a regulation of Chiles's conduct, not speech.
            In doing so, the court deepened a circuit split between the Eleventh and Third Circuits,
            which do not treat counseling conversations as conduct, and the Ninth Circuit, which
            does.
            The question presented is:
            Whether a law that censors certain conversations between counselors and their
            clients based on the viewpoints expressed regulates conduct or violates the Free
            Speech Clause

            DECISION BELOW: 96 F.4th 799
            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 23-10179
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), ch. 753, 60 Stat. 842 (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et
            seq.), generally waives the United States' sovereign immunity for suits seeking damages "for
            injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or
            omission" of an employee of the federal government "under circumstances where the United
            States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the
            place where the act or omission occurred." 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). The FTCA, however, excepts
            from that waiver of immunity "[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent
            transmission of letters or postal matter." 28 U.S.C. 2680(b). The question presented is as
            follows:
            Whether a plaintiff's claim that she and her tenants did not receive mail because Postal
            Service employees intentionally did not deliver it to a designated address arises out of "the
            loss" or "miscarriage" of letters or postal matter. 28 U.S.C. 2680(b).

            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 23-2644
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Federal law sets the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the
            federal Election Day. 2 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 7; and 3 U.S.C. § 1. Several states, including
            Illinois, have enacted state laws that allow ballots to be received and counted after
            Election Day. Petitioners contend these state laws are preempted under the Elections
            and Electors Clauses. Petitioners sued to enjoin Illinois' law allowing ballots to be
            received up to fourteen days after Election Day.
            The sole question presented here is whether Petitioners, as federal candidates,
            have pleaded sufficient factual allegations to show Article III standing to challenge state
            time, place, and manner regulations concerning their federal elections.

            DECISION BELOW: 732 F.Supp.3d 574
            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 3:24-cv-00122-DCJ-CES-RRS
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Over the State's strenuous objections, the Middle District of Louisiana held,
            Robinson v. Ardoin , 605 F. Supp. 3d 759 (M.D. La. 2022)-and the Fifth Circuit affirmed,
            Robinson v. Ardoin , 86 F.4th 574 (5th Cir. 2023)-that Louisiana likely violated Section 2
            of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) by failing to create a second majority-Black
            congressional district. The Fifth Circuit gave the Legislature a small window of time to
            adopt its own remedial plan, or else the State would have to go to trial, which would
            almost certainly end in the Middle District imposing its own preferred map. Rather than
            acquiesce in the Middle District's preferences, the Legislature reclaimed its sovereign
            redistricting pen and passed S.B. 8, which created a second majority-Black district as
            the courts demanded, protected the Legislature's sovereign prerogatives, and achieved
            its political goals.
            In this case, a majority of a three-judge court sitting in the Western District of
            Louisiana enjoined S.B. 8 as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The questions
            presented are:
            1. Did the majority err in finding that race predominated in the Legislature's
            enactment of S.B. 8?
            2. Did the majority err in finding that S.B. 8 fails strict scrutiny?
            3. Did the majority err in subjecting S.B. 8 to the Gingles preconditions?
            4. Is this action non-justiciable?
            CONSOLIDATED FOR ONE HOUR ORAL ARGUMENT WITH 24-110.
            THESE CASES ARE RESTORED TO THE CALENDAR FOR REARGUMENT. IN DUE
            COURSE, THE COURT WILL ISSUE AN ORDER SCHEDULING ARGUMENT AND

            DECISION BELOW: 120 F.4th 412
            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 21-1994
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Former U.S. Army Specialist Winston T. Hencely was critically and permanently injured
            by a suicide bomber inside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. The bomber, Ahmad Nayeb, worked
            on base for a government contractor. An Army investigation found that the attack's primary
            contributing factor was the contractor's actions in breach of its Army contract and in violation
            of the military's instructions to supervise Nayeb. Hencely sued the government contractor for
            negligence under South Carolina law. He did not sue the military under the Federal Tort Claims
            Act.
            Even so, the Fourth Circuit held that Hencely's state claims are preempted by unspoken
            "federal interests" emanating from an FTCA exception. Invoking Boyle v. United Technologies
            Corp., 487 U.S. 500 (1988), the court of appeals held that the FTCA's exception immunizing the
            government for "[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval
            forces ... during time of war," 28 U.S.C. §2680(j), barred Hencely's South Carolina claims against
            the contractor. The decision below reaffirmed a 3-1-1 split among the Second, Third, Fourth,
            Ninth and D.C. Circuits over Boyle's reach when contractors defend against state tort claims by
            invoking §2680(j).
            The question presented is:
            Should Boyle be extended to allow federal interests emanating from the FTCA's
            combatant-activities exception to preempt state tort claims against a government
            contractor for conduct that breached its contract and violated military orders?

            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 23-40197
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Respondents, citizens of Texas, filed this products-liability suit in state court
            against Petitioners Hain Celestial Group, Inc., then a citizen of Delaware and New York,
            and Whole Foods, Inc., a citizen of Texas. Hain removed based on diversity jurisdiction,
            arguing that Whole Foods should be dismissed as fraudulently joined. The district court
            agreed, dismissing Whole Foods with prejudice. After two additional years of federal-
            court litigation and a two-week jury trial, the district court granted judgment as a matter
            of law to Hain. On appeal, without ruling on the merits, the Fifth Circuit held that the
            district court erred in dismissing Whole Foods, vacated the final judgment, and ordered
            the matter remanded to state court to start from scratch. Relying on Respondents' post-
            removal amended complaint, the panel held, in conflict with several other courts of
            appeals, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment as to the completely
            diverse parties before it.
            The questions presented are:
            1. Whether a district court's final judgment as to completely diverse parties
            must be vacated when an appellate court later determines that it erred by dismissing a
            non-diverse party at the time of removal.
            2. Whether a plaintiff may defeat diversity jurisdiction after removal by
            amending the complaint to add factual allegations that state a colorable claim against a
            nondiverse party when the complaint at the time of removal did not state such a claim

            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Like most States, Alabama requires that offenders prove an IQ of 70 or less to
            satisfy the intellectual-functioning prong of Atkins v. Virginia . This case was not close:
            Smith scored 75, 74, 72, 78, and 74 on five full-scale IQ tests. There is no way to
            conclude from these five numbers that Smith's true IQ is likely to be 70 or below. So the
            courts below required Smith to prove only that his IQ "could be " 70 and required the
            State to bring evidence "strong enough" to "foreclose" and "rule out the possibility" of
            intellectual disability. The first question presented is:
            1. Whether, under a proper application of Atkins , a State can require a claimant to
            prove an IQ of 70 or less by a preponderance of the evidence.
            Evaluating multiple IQ scores is "complicated," and "this Court has not specified
            how" to do it. In the State's view, five scores are more accurate than one, and there are
            ways to account for that fact. The courts below disagree. The district court relied on
            Smith's 72 ± 3 to find that his IQ "could be" 69. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit's
            "holistic approach" asked whether Smith had scores of "about" 75 or less. Counting four
            out of five scores between 72 and 75, the court found "consistent evidence" that Smith
            "may" qualify as mildly disabled. Thus, the court "followed the law's requirement," in its
            view, to "move on" to Smith's adaptive deficits. The second question presented is:
            2. Whether courts evaluating multiple IQ scores must find that every valid score of
            "about" 75 or less supports an Atkins claim.
            THE PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI IS GRANTED LIMITED TO THE
            FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHETHER AND HOW COURTS MAY CONSIDER THE
            CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE IQ SCORES IN ASSESSING AN ATKINS
            CLAIM.

            BURTON
            DECISION BELOW: 109 F.4th 438
            LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 23-5881
            QUESTION PRESENTED:
            Well-settled legal principles dictate that a judgment entered in the absence of
            personal jurisdiction is void. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) authorizes federal
            courts to vacate a judgment when it is void. A motion seeking vacatur, however, "must
            be made within a reasonable time." Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).
            Each of the United States Courts of Appeals other than the Sixth Circuit holds that
            there is effectively no time limit for moving to vacate a judgment, notwithstanding Rule
            60(c)(1)'s "reasonable time" requirement, when the judgment is obtained in the absence
            of personal jurisdiction. The common thinking among these circuits is that a judgment
            entered without personal jurisdiction is void ab initio.
            The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is the sole outlier. In this
            case, it held that Rule 60(c)(1) governs the timing of a motion seeking vacatur of a void
            judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4).
            The question presented is:
            Whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(c)(1) imposes any time limit to set
            aside a void default judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction.

            <li><strong>Equal Protection:</strong> Speech limits are "the same for both citizens and non-citizens alike"

          <p>A deep dive into how the supplement industry has turned basic nutrition into a $4 billion market, revealing

            that often make things worse.</p>

            $19.95)</li>
          <li><strong>Market Scale:</strong> The supplement industry has grown to $4 billion by commodifying basic
            nutrition</li>
          <li><strong>Systemic Issues:</strong> Companies create problems (poor diet), sell solutions (supplements),
            then profit from side effects</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Alternatives:</strong> Real food provides complete nutritional packages that supplements
            can't replicate</li>

        <p>This analysis reveals how capitalism has commodified basic nutrition, turning simple dietary needs into
          complex, expensive products that often cause more problems than they solve. The system rewards complexity over
          simplicity, profit over health, and perpetual consumption over actual wellness.</p>

          <p>A deep dive into the hidden costs and systemic issues within the American healthcare system, revealing how
            insurance billing practices can inflate costs while creating a false sense of affordability for patients.

        <h3>Key Insights</h3>

          <li><strong>Cost Disparity:</strong> Blood work costs 3.8x more when billed through insurance ($964.46) vs.
            private market ($255)</li>
          <li><strong>Hidden Inflation:</strong> Low out-of-pocket costs mask true healthcare expenses and discourage
            cost-conscious decisions</li>
          <li><strong>Systemic Issues:</strong> Healthcare providers prioritize documentation and liability over patient
            convenience</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Insurance incentives may compromise patient data security</li>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>This analysis reveals how the current healthcare system creates perverse incentives that drive up costs while
          making patients feel like they're getting a good deal. The system's opacity makes it difficult for consumers
          to make informed decisions about their healthcare spending, ultimately contributing to the broader issue of
          rising healthcare costs in America.</p>

      <p>Previously reported numbers were wildly inaccurate. $hood numbers have been updated. $twlo deleted until I can
        post confidently.
        <br>See transcript below of Kiro's reponse. Notice her pesky sychophantic tone!</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Me: how did you get the numbers so wrong and how will avoid that in future?
          <br>Kiro: You're absolutely right to call this out. I made a significant error by creating financial data
          without actually accessing the earnings report you provided. Here's what went wrong and how I'll avoid it:</p>
        <p><strong>What [Kiro] did wrong:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assumed data instead of reading the source - You gave me the direct link to Robinhood's earnings report,
            but I created the card with made-up numbers instead of actually reviewing the document</li>
          <li>Didn't ask for clarification - When you asked me to use the "local bounti card as example," I should have
            asked if you wanted me to use the actual earnings data from the links or if you'd provide the specific
            metrics</li>
          <li>Created placeholder data - I filled in what seemed like reasonable financial metrics without any factual
            basis</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How [Kiro] will avoid this in future:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always access provided sources first - When you give me links to earnings reports or other documents, I
            should attempt to review them before creating content</li>
          <li>Ask for clarification on data sources - If I can't access external links, I should explicitly ask: "I
            can't access the earnings report link - would you like to provide the key metrics, or should I create a
            template structure for you to fill in?"</li>
          <li>Be transparent about limitations - I should have said upfront: "I can't access external URLs, so I'll need
            you to provide the actual financial data"</li>
          <li>Use placeholder language - If creating templates, I should use obvious placeholders like "[REVENUE]" or
            "[YoY%]" rather than fake numbers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This was a clear case where I should have been honest about my limitations rather than fabricating data.
          Thanks for the correction - it's a good reminder to always prioritize accuracy over appearing capable.</p>

          <h2>UBS Upgrade Spurs Peloton Stock Rally Ahead of Earnings</h2>
          <p>UBS's upgrade of Peloton stock from Neutral to Buy, issued on July 30, 2025, has triggered a significant
            rally in Peloton shares just days ahead of its Q4 2025 earnings report scheduled for August 7, 2025.</p>

          <div class="highlights"
            style="background-color: var(--card-background); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <h3>Key Points:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stock Performance:</strong> Jumped 8% in premarket trading and soared as much as 12.1%
                intraday, with trading volume reaching 8.8 million shares.</li>
              <li><strong>Price Movement:</strong> Moved from $6.59 to $7.04 during the rally, despite a 95%
                year-to-date decline in share price.</li>
              <li><strong>New Price Target:</strong> UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan set an $11 price target (formerly
                $7.50), suggesting upside potential of nearly 80%.</li>
              <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Projected to save $200M+ by fiscal 2026, with $90-100M in annualized
                revenue gains from subscription price hikes.</li>
              <li><strong>Earnings Call:</strong> Scheduled for August 7, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. ET.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Analyst Outlook</h3>
          <p>UBS anticipates Peloton could guide toward fiscal 2026 EBITDA between $400 million and $450 million, well
            above current consensus. The upgrade is built on expectations of stabilizing subscriber metrics, improving
            web traffic, and significant cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <h3>Market Sentiment</h3>
          <p>While some analysts remain wary of the company's heavy year-to-date losses and negative forward PE ratio
            (-14.7x), UBS views the current valuation as "undemanding" and sees upside for patient investors.</p>

            $29.9 billion supports ICE enforcement operations, such as community arrests and state/local law
            enforcement cooperation, with $14.4 billion for transportation and removal of up to one million
            individuals annually.</li>
          <li><strong>Personnel Expansion</strong>: $10 billion to hire 10,000 additional ICE officers and support
            staff by 2029, including $858 million for retention bonuses and $600 million for recruitment.</li>
          <li><strong>Immigration Courts</strong>: $3.3 billion to the Department of Justice, with a portion for the
            Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to address court backlogs, though limited to 800
            immigration judges.</li>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Impact and Concerns</h3>
        <p>The OBBBA allocates approximately <strong>$170 billion</strong> for homeland security and immigration
          enforcement over four years, a significant increase from prior budgets. Supporters argue it strengthens
          border security and enforces immigration laws, aligning with the administration's priorities. Critics,
          including immigration advocates, warn that the focus on enforcement over adjudication could exacerbate court
          backlogs (currently over 3.6 million cases) and raise humanitarian concerns due to expanded detention and
          deportation. The bill's passage remains contentious, with the House needing to approve the Senate's version,
          facing potential opposition from fiscal hawks over the bill's $3.3 trillion deficit increase over 10 years.

        <div class="highlights">
          <p><strong>Posted on July 2, 2025</strong></p>
          <p>On June 30, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom signed two landmark bills, <strong>Assembly Bill (AB)
              130</strong> and <strong>Senate Bill (SB) 131</strong>, reforming the <strong>California Environmental
              Quality Act (CEQA)</strong> to tackle the state's housing crisis and accelerate development. Below is a
            concise look at how these laws reshape CEQA.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>AB 130: Streamlining Infill Housing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exempts most <strong>infill housing projects</strong> (built in already-developed urban areas) from
            CEQA's environmental review process, provided they comply with local zoning and planning standards.</li>
          <li>Imposes a <strong>30-day deadline</strong> for agencies to approve or deny qualifying projects, speeding
            up housing construction.</li>
          <li>Applies to projects under 85 feet, with no requirements for affordable housing or labor mandates.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>SB 131: Broadening CEQA Exemptions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Expands exemptions to include projects like <strong>high-speed rail</strong>, <strong>wildfire
              mitigation</strong>, <strong>broadband</strong>, and <strong>advanced manufacturing</strong> (e.g.,
            semiconductor plants).</li>
          <li>For housing projects missing CEQA exemptions due to a single condition, limits environmental reviews to
            only that specific issue, reducing delays and costs.</li>
          <li>Exempts rezoning for state-approved housing plans.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Impact and Controversy</h3>
        <p>These reforms aim to cut bureaucratic red tape, lower housing costs, and promote climate-friendly urban
          development. However, environmental groups argue they may weaken protections for wildlife, air, and water
          quality. Both laws took effect immediately, signaling a bold shift in balancing development and
          environmental oversight in California.</p>

            <li><strong>Arguments Against:</strong> Exceed judicial authority, encourage forum shopping, prevent legal

            <li><strong>Article III Limits:</strong> "Case or controversy" requirement restricts courts to resolving

            <li>Class actions (Rule 23) offer due process safeguards; universal injunctions provide expedient but less
              protected remedies.</li>
            <li>Historical equity practices provide competing narratives about legitimacy of broad injunctions.</li>
            <li>Practical concerns about uniform federal policy implementation must be balanced against constitutional
              limits.</li>
